Brown University
Brown University is a private Ivy League research
university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Itis the seventh-oldest institution of higher education inthe US, founded in 1764 as the College in the English
Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the
American Revolution,[7] it was the first US college to
codify that admission and instruction of students was tobe equal regardless of the religious affiliation of
students.[8]
The university is home to the oldest applied
mathematics program in the country and oldestengineering program in the Ivy League.[a][9][10][11] It
was one of the early doctoral-granting institutions in theU.S., adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[12] In
1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after studentlobbying, which eliminated mandatory general
education distribution requirements.[13][14] In 1971,
Brown's coordinate women's institution, PembrokeCollege, was fully merged into the university.
The university comprises the College, the GraduateSchool, Alpert Medical School, the School ofEngineering, the School of Public Health and the School
of Professional Studies. Its international programs areorganized through the Watson Institute forInternational and Public Affairs, and it is academically
affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and theRhode Island School of Design, which offersundergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.Brown's main campus is in the College Hill
neighborhood of Providence. The university issurrounded by a federally listed architectural districtwith a concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit
Street has one of America's richest concentrations of17th- and 18th-century architecture.[15][16]
Undergraduate admissions are among the mostselective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 5%for the class of 2026.[17][18]

As of March 2022, 11 Nobel Prize winners, 1 Fields
Medalist, 7 National Humanities Medalists,[b] and 11
National Medal of Science laureates have been affiliatedwith Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers. Alumni
also include 27 Pulitzer Prize winners,[c] 21billionaires,[d] 4 U.S. Secretaries of State, over 100
members of the United States Congress,[25] 58 Rhodes

In 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island,drafted a petition to the colony's GeneralAssembly:[28]
That your Petitioners propose to open aliterary institution or School forinstructing young Gentlemen in the
Languages, Mathematics, Geography &History, & such other branches ofKnowledge as shall be desired. That for
this End... it will be necessary... to erecta public Building or Buildings for theboarding of the youth & the Residence
of the Professors.
The three petitioners were Ezra Stiles, pastor ofNewport's Second Congregational Church and future president of Yale University; William Ellery Jr.,
future signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; and Josias Lyndon, future governor ofthe colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. Theeditor of Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr.
Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became BrownUniversity."[28][29][12]
The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches was also interested in establishing a college inRhode Island, which was home of the mother church of their denomination. At the time, the Baptistswere unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard University and
Yale University, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey, which later became PrincetonUniversity, and the Episcopalians had the College of William & Mary and King's College, which laterbecame Columbia University. The local University of Pennsylvania in their native Philadelphia was

Brown's ﬁrst president,minister James ManningThe Ezra Stiles copy ofBrown's 1764 charter
founded by Benjamin Franklin without direct association with any particular denomination.[30] Isaac
Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of theOctober 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:[12]
The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bringthem to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colonyof Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning, who took
his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader inthis important work.
James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the
charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejectedby Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the CollegeBoard of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island
General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.[31]
In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the
corporation—the college's governing body—washeld in Newport's Old Colony House. GovernorStephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former
and future governor Samuel Ward vicechancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, andThomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated
that the board of trustees should be composed of22 Baptists, five Quakers, five Episcopalians, andfour Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight
should be Baptists—including the collegepresident—"and the rest indifferently of any orall Denominations."[12]
At the time of its creation, Brown's charter was auniquely progressive document.[32] Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing
doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Partof the Public and Classical Instruction." The document additionally "recognized more broadly andfundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation."[12]
The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for Collegemembership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.[33]
The college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First Baptist Church in Warren,
Rhode Island.[34] Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the
role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to"solicit Benefactions for this Institution".[33] During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles,
Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.[33]

Following the gift of Nicholas BrownJr. ( C lass of 1786), the universitywas renamed in his honor.
In 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. Toestablish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre
lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majorityof the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot ofChad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original
proprietors of Providence Plantations.[35] After the college wasrelocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.
A building committee, organized by the corporation, developedplans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a designon February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as "The
College Edifice" and later as University Hall, may have beenmodeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of NewJersey. President Manning, an active member of the building
process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemblethat of his alma mater.[36]
Nicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brownwere instrumental in moving the college to Providence,
constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Josephbecame a professor of natural philosophy at the college; Johnserved as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son
Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to1825.[37]
On September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, "That the donationof $5,000, if made to this College within one Year from the lateCommencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." The
following year, the appeal was answered by College TreasurerNicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Browncommitted "a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island
College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment ofa Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters." In recognition ofthe gift, the corporation on the same day voted, "That this Collegebe called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown
University."[38] Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 andincluded funds for building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).
In 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research libraryon Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son ofNicholas Brown Jr.
The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth bothdirectly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue ofslavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent

abolitionists.
In 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering
committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to addressthem.[39]
With British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved outof Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's
University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General GeorgeWashington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led tothe Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the
defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital fromDecember 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May27, 1782.[12]
A number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequentfounding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the
Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. JamesManning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently servingas Brown's first president.[40] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed
the Declaration of Independence.
James Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General
George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command ofthe entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode
Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[41] David Howell,
who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to1785.
Nineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012,
Christina Hull Paxson has served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of PrincetonUniversity's School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economicsdepartment.[42] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first AfricanAmerican president of an Ivy League institution.[43] Other presidents of note include academic,Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland.
In 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80
students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools,especially San Francisco State College, and sought ways to "put students at the center of theireducation" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts".[44]

Brown's 18th President,Ruth Simmons, was theIvy League's ﬁrst African-American president.
Brown's 19thPresident,  C hristinaPaxson, has servedin the role since2012.
Members of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwellpublished a paper of their findings titled, "Draft of a
Working Paper for Education at BrownUniversity."[45][44] The paper made proposals for a new
curriculum, including interdisciplinary freshman-yearcourses that would introduce "modes of thought," withinstruction from faculty from different disciplines as
well as for an end to letter grades. The following yearMagaziner began organizing the student body to pressfor the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.[46]
In 1968, university president Ray Heffner established aSpecial Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed
of administrators, the committee was tasked withdeveloping specific reforms and producingrecommendations. A report, produced by the
committee, was presented to the faculty, which votedthe New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Itskey features included:[47]
Modes of Thought courses for ﬁrst-year students
The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
The abandonment of "general education" distributionrequirements
The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option
The ABC/No Credit grading system, whicheliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of "NoCredit" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) wouldnot appear on external transcripts.
The Modes of Thought course was discontinued earlyon, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the
reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation.The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, andstudents, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[48]
In 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown'seighteenth-century ties to slavery. In October 2006, the committee released a report documenting itsfindings.[49][50]
Titled "Slavery and Justice", the document detailed the ways in which the university benefited bothdirectly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade and the labor of enslaved people. The report
also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this legacy.[51] Brown hassince completed a number of these recommendations including the establishment of its Center for theStudy of Slavery and Justice, the construction of its Slavery Memorial, and the funding of a $10
million permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools.[51][52]

University Hall, Brown's oldest building, wasconstructed in 1770 and is a National HistoricLandmark
Soldiers Memorial  G ate (1921) long marked theeastern edge of Brown's campus.
The "Slavery and Justice" report marked the first major effort by an American university to address itsties to slavery and prompted other institutions to undertake similar processes.[53][54]
Brown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis Wayland hadcommissioned a committee to update the school's original seal to match the name the university had
adopted in 1804. Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon divided into four sectors by a redcross. Within each sector of the coat of arms lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting ofthe upper half of a sun in splendor among the clouds atop a red and white torse.[55]
Brown is the largest institutional landowner inProvidence, with properties on College Hill and in the
Jewelry District.[56] The university was built
contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's
campus tightly integrated into Providence's urbanfabric. Among the noted architects who have shapedBrown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip
Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, andRobert A. M. Stern.[57]
Brown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and 143
acres (0.58 km2) in the East Side neighborhood ofCollege Hill. The university's central campus sits on a
15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman,Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildingsextend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's
core, historic campus, constructed primary between1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front orQuiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth
J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as LincolnField).[58][59] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the
block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in itsarchitectural character.[58]
To the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, includingWriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit SciencesPark and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts

facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academicbuildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the
John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.
The university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is locatedimmediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.
Built in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gatesthat stand at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main
gate is flanked by two smaller side gates. At Convocation thecentral gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students;at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of
graduates.[60] A Brown superstition holds that students who walkthrough the central gate a second time prematurely will not
graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.
The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus.[61]
Opened in 1910, the library is named for John Hay (class of 1858),
private secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State underWilliam McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The construction ofthe building was funded in large part by Hay's friend, Andrew
Carnegie, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost ofconstruction.[62]
The John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university'sarchives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections.Noteworthy among the latter are the Anne S. K. Brown Military
Collection[63] (described as "the foremost American collection ofmaterial devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and
soldiering"),[64] the Harris Collection of American Poetry andPlays (described as "the largest and most comprehensive collection
of its kind in any research library"), the Lownes Collection of theHistory of Science (described as "one of the three most important private collections of books ofscience in America"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft. The Hay Library is home to one of thebroadest collections of incunabula in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios, the
manuscript of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and three books bound in human skin.[65]
Founded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the world's leadingcollection of primary historical sources relating to the exploration and colonization of the Americas.
While administered and funded separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brownand located on its campus since 1904.[67]

The galleries of Brown'santhropology museum, theHaffenreffer, are located in ManningHall.
The library contains the best preserved of the eleven survivingcopies of the Bay Psalm Book—the earliest extant book printed in
British North America and the most expensive printed book in theworld.[68] Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio and
the world's largest collection of 16th-century Mexican texts.[69]
The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum ofAnthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning
Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts,available for research and educational purposes, are located at itsCollections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island.[70] The
museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking aboutculture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the
material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and studentsto work with collections and the public, teaching through objectsand programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum
sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology and alsoruns an extensive program of outreach to local schools.
The Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General
Rush Hawkins, as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, amember of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the finalrepository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works
of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings byAngelica Kauffman, Peter Paul Rubens, Gilbert Stuart, GiovanniBattista Tiepolo, Benjamin West, and Eastman Johnson, among
others. His collection of over 450 incunabula was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.[71] Todaythe Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.
The Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It
runs parallel to Thayer Street and serves as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth SimmonsQuadrangle at its southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at itsnorthern end.[72][73] The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as the LindemannPerforming Arts Center and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts
The corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Friedman.[74]

Three dormitories, Metcalf Hall(1919), Andrews Hall (1947), andMiller Hall (1910), formed the heartof Pembroke  C ollege and now serveas freshman residences.
The Women's College in Brown University, known as PembrokeCollege, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger withthe College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was
absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus isbordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sitsthree blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is
dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian andVictorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprisesPembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf
Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927)and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the northwith Andrews Hall (1947).
East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of BryantUniversity. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brownpurchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10
acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[75] Today, thearea is largely used for dormitories.
Thayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students,Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in theadjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.
Built in 1925, Brown Stadium—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately amile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[76] Marston Boathouse, the home of
Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams arebased out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.
Since 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry
District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and theWomen and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular
medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[77][78]
Brown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River.Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island,
an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's HaffenrefferMuseum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, islocated in the Mount Hope Grant.
Brown has committed to "minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and
promote environmental stewardship."[79] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildingsmeet LEED silver standards.[80] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by

27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Projectwhich converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered
system.[81]
In 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader
divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[82] In 2021, theuniversity adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and
achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[83] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus SustainabilityConsortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of
campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[84]
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant
vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (104) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern HardwoodForest (25).[85]
Founded in 1764, The College is Brown's oldest school. About7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college , and 81
concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, themost popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics,Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations,
and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduatescomplete more than one concentration before graduating.[86] If
the existing programs do not align with their intended curricularinterests, undergraduates may design and pursue independentconcentrations.[87]
Around 35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate orprofessional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80
percent within 10 years.[88] For the Class of 2009, 56 percent of allundergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among undergraduate alumni who go on
to receive graduate degrees, the most common degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%),M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D. (11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earngraduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University, and Harvard University.[89]
The highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after graduation are educationand higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and

The  G ranoff  C enter, designed byDiller Scoﬁdio + Renfro, hosts theannual Brown|RISD Dual Degreeexhibition.
Since its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School ofDesign (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brownand RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two
institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many asfour courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree.[90] The
two institutions partner to provide various student-life servicesand the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hillcultural scene.
After several years of discussion between the two institutions andseveral students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and
RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.[91] The
Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective inthe country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for theclass entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.[92]
The program combines the complementary strengths of the twoinstitutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are
admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both theBachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts(B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be
accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a thirdBrown|RISD joint committee.
Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD
completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studiescurriculum while taking up to three Brown classes. Students spendtheir second year in residence at Brown, during which students
take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD majorrequirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students canelect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution
is determined by the requirements of each student's uniquecombination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Programparticipants are noted for their creative and original approach tocross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example,
industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration withhuman biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture withurban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized
and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the broader world of industry,design, the media, and the fine arts.

Brown began offering computer science courses through thedepartments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an IBM 650 in
January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford andBoston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computerbuilding, the Brown University Computing Laboratory. The
facility, designed by Philip Johnson, received an IBM 7070computer the following year. The first undergraduate ComputerScience degrees were awarded in 1974. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in
1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflopsstandards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.[102]
In the 1960s, Andries van Dam, along with Ted Nelson and Bob Wallace invented The HypertextEditing Systems, HES and FRESS while at Brown. Nelson coined the word hypertext while Van Dam'sstudents helped originate XML, XSLT, and related Web standards. Among the school's computer
science alumni are principal architect of the Classic Mac OS, Andy Hertzfeld; principal architect of theIntel 80386 and Intel 80486 microprocessors, John Crawford; former CEO of Apple, John Sculley;and digital effects programmer Masi Oka.[103][104] Other alumni include former CS department head
at MIT, John Guttag; software-defined networking pioneer Scott Shenker; Workday founder, AneelBhusri; MongoDB founder Eliot Horowitz; Figma founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace (the latterof whom also created esbuild); OpenSea founder Devin Finzer; and Edward D. Lazowska, professor
and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Chair emeritus at the University of Washington.[105]
Between 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled.[106] In 2017, computer science
overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate concentration.[107]

Richard Holbrooke (Class of 1962),[118] and Sergei
Khrushchev,[119] editor of the papers of his father NikitaKhrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union.
The institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal
themes of development, security, and governance—with furtherfocuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, andpoverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: Development
Studies, International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and CaribbeanStudies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies.  G raduate programs offered atthe Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public
Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development, and globaloutreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, includingthe Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies Center, The Centerfor Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In
recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its Costs of WarProject, first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team ofeconomists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate
the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan,and Pakistan since 2001.[120]
Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest
civilian engineering program in the country.[g] In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical,and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was
elevated to a School of Engineering.[122]

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school isorganized without the traditional departments or boundaries
found at most schools and follows a model of connectivity betweendisciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry,computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. The
school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in whichengineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence ofideas.
Student teams have launched two CubeSats with the support of theSchool of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developedEQUiSat a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team
developed SBUDNIC a 3U satellite.[123][124]
Since 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leadingBusiness Schools in Europe, IE Business School in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened
resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[125] In this partnership, Brown providesits traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a
differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[126] The cohort typically consists of25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[127] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, CapeTown and Online.
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women wasestablished at Brown in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott as an
interdisciplinary research center on gender.[128] The center isnamed for Pembroke College, Brown's former women's college,
and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle Women's Center. ThePembroke Center supports Brown's undergraduate concentrationin Gender and Sexuality Studies, post-doctoral research
fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academicprograms. It also manages various collections, archives, andresources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers
and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.
Brown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted itsfirst advanced degrees in 1888. The university established aGraduate Department in 1903 and a full Graduate School in 1927.[129]

With an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the schoolcurrently offers 33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs,
respectively. The school additionally offers a number of fifth-yearmaster's programs.[130] Overall, admission to the Graduate School
is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging atapproximately 9 percent in recent years.
The Robert J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science isBrown's cross-departmental neuroscience research institute. The
institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces andcomputational neuroscience; additional areas of focus include research into mechanisms of cell deathwith the interest of developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
The Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain Scienceand renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift.[131] The donation, one of the largest in the
university's history, established the institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscienceprograms in the country.[132]
Established in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth
oldest medical school in the Ivy League.[11][h]
In 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis
Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a newpolicy requiring students to live on campus. The program wasreorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program
in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the BrownUniversity School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown
Medical School in October 2000.[133] In January 2007,entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of
the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in thecountry, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%.[134] U.S. News ranks the school 38th for research and 35th
for primary care.[135]
Brown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education
(PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, theprogram is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offeringadmission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[136]

Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursuecareers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the
University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to acceptapplications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most othermedical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree
programs.
Brown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert MedicalSchool's Department of Community Health and was officiallyfounded in 2013 as an independent school.[137][138] The school
issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.), graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M.,A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees (M.P.H./M.P.A.,
M.D./M.P.H.).[139]
The Brown University School of Professional Studies currentlyoffers blended learning Executive master's degrees in Healthcare
Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and TechnologyLeadership.[140] The master's degrees are designed to help
students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress intheir respective fields. The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a weekly seminar eachtrimester.
The university has also invested in MOOC development starting in 2013, when two courses,Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets and The Fiction of Relationship, both of which received thousands ofstudents.[141] However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera and
revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university releasednew courses on edx, two of which were The Ethics of Memory and Artful Medicine: Art's Power to
Enrich Patient Care. In January 2018, Brown published its first "game-ified" course called FantasticPlaces, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature, which featured out-of-platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into
a fictional world to help characters along their journey.[142]
Undergraduate admission to Brown University isconsidered "most selective" by U.S. News & World
Report.[145] For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown
received 50,649 applications—the largest applicant pool

Washington Monthly ranked Brown 30th in 2024 among 438 nationaluniversities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as
measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[170]
In 2022, U.S. News & World Report ranks Brown 129th globally.
In 2014, Forbes magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of "America's MostEntrepreneurial Universities."[171] The Forbes analysis looked at the ratio of
"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders andbusiness owners on LinkedIn" and the total number of alumni and students.LinkedIn particularized the Forbes rankings, placing Brown third (between
MIT and Princeton) among "Best Undergraduate Universities for SoftwareDevelopers at Startups." LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-pathexamination of "millions of alumni profiles" in its membership database.[172]
In 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbrightrecipients of any university in the nation.[173][174][175] Brown has also
produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in theUnited States.[176]
In 2025 the university ranked 229 of 257 top colleges in free speech rankingsby the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and "College Pulse,"
after ranking at 69 in 2024 and at 114 in 2022/2023.[177][178][179]
Brown is a member of the Association of American Universities since 1933and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research
Activity".[180][181] In FY 2017, Brown spent $212.3 million on research and was ranked 103rd in theUnited States by total R&D expenditure by National Science Foundation.[182][183] In 2021 Brown's
School of Public Health received the 4th most funding in NIH awards among schools of public healthin the U.S.[184]
In 2014, Brown tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in thenation, with its "total of reports of rape" on their main campus standing at 43.[186] However, such
rankings have been criticized for failing to account for how different campus environments canencourage or discourage individuals from reporting sexual assault cases, thereby affecting the numberof reported rapes.[187]

Many Spring Weekend events arehosted on Brown's Main  G reen.[192]
Ladd Observatory, built 1890–1891,is used by Brown SpaceEngineering, a student groupfocused on aerospace engineering.
Established in 1950, Spring Weekend is anannual spring music festival for students.Historical performers at the festival have
included Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie,Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin,Bruce Springsteen, and U2. More recent
headliners include Kendrick Lamar, YoungThug, Daniel Caesar, Anderson .Paak,Mitski, Aminé, and Mac
DeMarco.[188][189][190][191] Since 1960,Spring Weekend has been organized by the
student-run Brown Concert Agency.
Approximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in GreekLife.[193] The university recognizes thirteen active Greek
organizations. Since the early 1950s, all Greek organizations oncampus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.[194]
The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate.
The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of SolomonDrowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[12] The
organization seems to have disappeared during the AmericanRevolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the MisokosmianSociety (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the
Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), thePhilophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824).Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many
supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.[195][196]
Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger
societies generally leaned Republican.[12]
Societies remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were
largely replaced by fraternities.[196]
The Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the
club served as the de facto undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.

In 2023, 38% of Brown's students identified as being LGBTQ+, in a poll by The Brown Daily
Herald.[197] The 2023 LGBTQ+ self-identification level was an increase, up from 14% LGBTidentification in 2010.[197] "Bisexual" was the most common answer amongst LGBTQ+ respondents to
the poll.[197]
Brown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often
act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students toexplore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centersoften provide physical spaces for students to study and have
meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, someprovide academic support as well.
The Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC) is a space that
provides support for students of color. Established in 1972 at thedemand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students toengage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote
social justice.[198] The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge andengage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer

women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle. The center emphasizes intersectionality in its conversations ongender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center
hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students,faculty, and staff.[200]
Other centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (U-FLi) Center,[201] and the Curricular Resource Center.
On December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest ofan atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a "stifling, frustrating, [and] degradingplace for Black students" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65
Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black studentenrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US.This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands
have yet to be met.[202][203]
In the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain companies involved inSouth Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with partial divestment and began a fast in ManningChapel and the university disenrolled them. In April 1987, "dozens" of students interrupted a
university corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.[204]
In 2013, students and Providence community members protested and disrupted a speech by then-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The incident was cited by Greg Lukianoff, president of theFoundation for Individual Rights and Expression, as a high-profile example of a form of student
protest questioning conceptions of free speech.[205] The incident was also the subject of a short criticaldocumentary in 2016 by Brown alumnus Rob Montz.[206]
In early November 2023, twenty students of Jewish background staged a sit in at University hall,resulting in their arrests. The students were protesting the Israel-Hamas war and calling for a
ceasefire, as well as for the university to divest from companies that "facilitate the 'Israeli militaryoccupation' in Gaza." In early December 2023, forty-one more students held a sit-in with similar
