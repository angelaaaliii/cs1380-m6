Brown University is a private [/wiki/Private_university] Ivy League
[/wiki/Ivy_League] research university [/wiki/Research_university] in
Providence, Rhode Island [/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island], United States. It is
the seventh-oldest institution [/wiki/List_of_colonial_colleges] of higher
education [/wiki/Higher_education] in the US, founded in 1764 as the College in
the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. One of nine
colonial colleges [/wiki/Colonial_colleges] chartered before the American
Revolution [/wiki/American_Revolution],[7] it was the first US college to codify
that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of the
religious affiliation [/wiki/Religious_affiliation] of students.[8]

The university is home to the oldest applied mathematics
[/wiki/Applied_mathematics] program in the country and oldest engineering
program in the Ivy League.[a][9][10][11] It was one of the early
doctoral-granting institutions in the U.S., adding masters and doctoral studies
in 1887.[12] In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum
[/wiki/Open_Curriculum_(Brown_University)] after student lobbying, which
eliminated mandatory general education [/wiki/Curriculum#Core_curriculum]
distribution requirements.[13][14] In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's
institution, Pembroke College [/wiki/Pembroke_College_in_Brown_University], was
fully merged into the university.

The university comprises the College [/wiki/College_of_Brown_University], the
Graduate School [/wiki/Graduate_School_of_Brown_University], Alpert Medical
School [/wiki/Alpert_Medical_School], the School of Engineering
[/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Engineering], the School of Public Health
[/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Public_Health] and the School of Professional
Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute
for International and Public Affairs
[/wiki/Watson_Institute_for_International_and_Public_Affairs], and it is
academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory
[/wiki/Marine_Biological_Laboratory] and the Rhode Island School of Design
[/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design], which offers undergraduate and graduate
dual degree programs. Brown's main campus is in the College Hill
[/wiki/College_Hill,_Providence,_Rhode_Island] neighborhood of Providence. The
university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district

[/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Yale_University] of Yale College

Petitioner William Ellery [/wiki/William_Ellery] signed the United States
Declaration of Independence [/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence] in
1776.

In 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island [/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island],
drafted a petition to the colony's General Assembly
[/wiki/Rhode_Island_General_Assembly]:[28]

> That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for
> instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography &
> History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this
> End... it will be necessary... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the
> boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.

The three petitioners were Ezra Stiles [/wiki/Ezra_Stiles], pastor of Newport's
Second Congregational Church [/wiki/Clarke_Street_Meeting_House] and future
president of Yale University [/wiki/Yale_University]; William Ellery Jr.
[/wiki/William_Ellery], future signer
[/wiki/Signing_of_the_United_States_Declaration_of_Independence] of the United
States Declaration of Independence
[/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence]; and Josias Lyndon
[/wiki/Josias_Lyndon], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery later
served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of
Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other
evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island,
before the charter of what became Brown University."[28][29][12]

The Philadelphia [/wiki/Philadelphia] Association of Baptist Churches was also
interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island, which was home of the
mother church of their denomination [/wiki/First_Baptist_Church_in_America]. At
the time, the Baptists [/wiki/Baptists] were unrepresented among the colonial
colleges; the Congregationalists [/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States]
had Harvard University [/wiki/Harvard_University] and Yale University, the
Presbyterians [/wiki/Presbyterianism] had the College of New Jersey, which later
became Princeton University [/wiki/Princeton_University], and the Episcopalians
[/wiki/Church_of_England] had the College of William & Mary
[/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary] and King's College, which later became
Columbia University [/wiki/Columbia_University]. The local University of
Pennsylvania [/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania] in their native Philadelphia was
founded by Benjamin Franklin [/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin] without direct
association with any particular denomination.[30] Isaac Backus, a historian of
the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the October
1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:[12]

> The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs,
> as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to
> erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of
> the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning [/wiki/James_Manning_(minister)], who took
> his first degree in New-Jersey college [/wiki/Princeton_University] in
> September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.

James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who
agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the
General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected by Baptist members who worried
that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of
Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode
Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich
[/wiki/East_Greenwich,_Rhode_Island].[31]

The Ezra Stiles [/wiki/Ezra_Stiles] copy of Brown's 1764 charter

In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation—the college's
governing body—was held in Newport's Old Colony House [/wiki/Old_Colony_House].
Governor Stephen Hopkins [/wiki/Stephen_Hopkins_(politician)] was chosen
chancellor, former and future governor Samuel Ward
[/wiki/Samuel_Ward_(Rhode_Island_politician)] vice chancellor, John Tillinghast
treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of
trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, five Quakers
[/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends], five Episcopalians, and four
Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the
college president—"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations."[12]

At the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive
document.[32] Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing
doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions,
shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction." The document
additionally "recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other
[university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation."[12] The
oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test
for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly
liberal in that particular.[33]

1792 engraving is the first published image of Brown. University Hall
[/wiki/University_Hall_(Brown_University)] stands on the right while the
President's House sits on the left.

The college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First
Baptist Church in Warren, Rhode Island [/wiki/Warren,_Rhode_Island].[34] Manning
was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the role
until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend [/wiki/The_Reverend]
Morgan Edwards [/wiki/Morgan_Edwards] to travel to Europe to "solicit
Benefactions for this Institution".[33] During his year-and-a-half stay in the
British Isles [/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute], Edwards secured funding from
benefactors including Thomas Penn [/wiki/Thomas_Penn] and Benjamin Franklin
[/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin].[33]

In 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus,
John [/wiki/John_Brown_(Rhode_Island_politician)] and Moses Brown
[/wiki/Moses_Brown] purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill
[/wiki/College_Hill,_Providence,_Rhode_Island] on behalf of the school. The
majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad
Brown [/wiki/Chad_Brown_(minister)], an ancestor of the Browns and one of the
original proprietors of Providence Plantations
[/wiki/Providence_Plantations].[35] After the college was relocated to the city,
work began on constructing its first building.

A building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the
college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770.
The subsequent structure, referred to as "The College Edifice" and later as
University Hall [/wiki/University_Hall_(Brown_University)], may have been
modeled on Nassau Hall [/wiki/Nassau_Hall], built 14 years prior at the College
of New Jersey [/wiki/Princeton_University]. President Manning, an active member
of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that
Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater [/wiki/Alma_mater].[36]

BROWN FAMILY

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=3]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Nicholas_Brown_Jr_by_Chester_Harding_1836.jpg/250px-Nicholas_Brown_Jr_by_Chester_Harding_1836.jpg]/wiki/File:Nicholas_Brown_Jr_by_Chester_Harding_1836.jpgFollowing
the gift of Nicholas Brown Jr. [/wiki/Nicholas_Brown_Jr.] (Class of 1786), the
university was renamed in his honor.

Nicholas Brown [/wiki/Nicholas_Brown_Sr.], John Brown
[/wiki/John_Brown_(Rhode_Island_politician)], Joseph Brown
[/wiki/Joseph_Brown_(astronomer)], and Moses Brown [/wiki/Moses_Brown] were
instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first
building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural
philosophy [/wiki/Natural_philosophy] at the college; John served as its
treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr.
[/wiki/Nicholas_Brown_Jr.] succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to
1825.[37]

On September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, "That the donation of $5,000, if
made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle
the donor to name the College." The following year, the appeal was answered by
College Treasurer Nicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown
committed "a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island College, to
remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of a Professorship of
Oratory and Belles Letters." In recognition of the gift, the corporation on the
same day voted, "That this College be called and known in all future time by the
Name of Brown University."[38] Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas
Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and included funds for building Hope College
(1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).

In 1904, the John Carter Brown Library [/wiki/John_Carter_Brown_Library] was
established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the
library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown
[/wiki/John_Carter_Brown], son of Nicholas Brown Jr.

The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and
accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade
[/wiki/Transatlantic_Slave_Trade]. The family was divided on the issue of
slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr.
were fervent abolitionists [/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States].

In 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons [/wiki/Ruth_Simmons], the
university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the
university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.[39]

AMERICAN REVOLUTION

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=4]]

With British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay [/wiki/Narragansett_Bay] in the
fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping.
During the subsequent American Revolutionary War
[/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War], Brown's University Hall
[/wiki/University_Hall_(Brown_University)] was used to house French and other
revolutionary troops led by General George Washington [/wiki/George_Washington]
and the Comte de Rochambeau [/wiki/Comte_de_Rochambeau] as they waited to
commence the march of 1781 [/wiki/Washington-Rochambeau_Revolutionary_Route]
that led to the Siege of Yorktown [/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown] and the Battle of
the Chesapeake [/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake]. This has been celebrated as
marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building
functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780,
and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.[12]

A number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution
and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen
Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany
[/wiki/Albany_Congress] in 1754, and to the Continental Congress
[/wiki/Continental_Congress] from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode
Island at the Congress of the Confederation
[/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation], while concurrently serving as Brown's
first president.[40] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins
signed the Declaration of Independence [/wiki/Declaration_of_independence].

James Mitchell Varnum [/wiki/James_Mitchell_Varnum], who graduated from Brown
with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental
Army [/wiki/Continental_Army] brigadier generals [/wiki/Brigadier_general] and
later as major general [/wiki/Major_general] in command of the entire Rhode
Island militia [/wiki/Rhode_Island_militia]. Varnum is noted as the founder and
commander of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment [/wiki/1st_Rhode_Island_Regiment],
widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[41] David
Howell [/wiki/David_Howell_(jurist)], who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served
as a delegate to the Continental Congress [/wiki/Continental_Congress] from 1782
to 1785.

Nineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its
founding in 1764. Since 2012, Christina Hull Paxson
[/wiki/Christina_Hull_Paxson] has served as president. Paxson had previously
served as dean of Princeton University's [/wiki/Princeton_University] School of
Public and International Affairs
[/wiki/Princeton_School_of_Public_and_International_Affairs] and chair of
Princeton's economics department.[42] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth
Simmons [/wiki/Ruth_Simmons], is noted as the first African American
[/wiki/African_American] president of an Ivy League institution.[43] Other
presidents of note include academic, Vartan Gregorian [/wiki/Vartan_Gregorian];
and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland [/wiki/Francis_Wayland].


NEW CURRICULUM

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=6]]
Main article: Open Curriculum (Brown University)
[/wiki/Open_Curriculum_(Brown_University)]

In 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed,
involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by
student-initiated experimental schools, especially San Francisco State College
[/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University], and sought ways to "put students at the
center of their education" and "teach students how to think rather than just
teaching facts".[44]

Members of the GISP, Ira Magaziner [/wiki/Ira_Magaziner] and Elliot Maxwell
published a paper of their findings titled, "Draft of a Working Paper for
Education at Brown University."[45][44] The paper made proposals for a new
curriculum, including interdisciplinary [/wiki/Interdisciplinary] freshman-year
courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with instruction from faculty
from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following
year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms,
organizing discussions and protests.[46]

In 1968, university president Ray Heffner [/wiki/Ray_Heffner] established a
Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed of administrators, the
committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and producing
recommendations. A report, produced by the committee, was presented to the
faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key
features included:[47]

 * Modes of Thought courses for first-year students
 * The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
 * The abandonment of "general education" distribution requirements
 * The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option
 * The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's;
   a grade of "No Credit" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would not
   appear on external transcripts.

The Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements
remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed
in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the
College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students,
including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[48]


"SLAVERY AND JUSTICE" REPORT

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=7]]

In 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons [/wiki/Ruth_Simmons] launched a
steering committee to research Brown's eighteenth-century ties to slavery. In
October 2006, the committee released a report documenting its findings.[49][50]

Titled "Slavery and Justice", the document detailed the ways in which the
university benefited both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave
trade [/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade] and the labor of enslaved people. The report
also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this
legacy.[51] Brown has since completed a number of these recommendations
including the establishment of its Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice,
the construction of its Slavery Memorial
[/wiki/Slavery_Memorial_(Brown_University)], and the funding of a $10 million
permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools
[/wiki/Providence_Public_School_District].[51][52]

The "Slavery and Justice" report marked the first major effort by an American
university to address its ties to slavery and prompted other institutions to
undertake similar processes.[53][54]


COAT OF ARMS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=8]]
Main article: Coat of Arms of Brown University
[/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Brown_University]

Brown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis
Wayland [/wiki/Francis_Wayland] had commissioned a committee to update the
school's original seal to match the name the university had adopted in 1804.
Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon [/wiki/Escutcheon_(heraldry)]
divided into four sectors by a red cross. Within each sector of the coat of arms
lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a
sun in splendor [/wiki/Sun_in_splendor] among the clouds atop a red and white

Brown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on
College Hill and in the Jewelry District
[/wiki/Jewelry_District_(Providence)].[56] The university was built
contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts
surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban
fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim,
Mead & White [/wiki/McKim,_Mead_%26_White], Philip Johnson
[/wiki/Philip_Johnson], Rafael Viñoly [/wiki/Rafael_Vi%C3%B1oly], Diller

MAIN CAMPUS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=10]]
Further information: List of Brown University buildings
[/wiki/List_of_Brown_University_buildings]

Brown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and 143 acres (0.58 km2) in the
East Side [/wiki/East_Side,_Providence,_Rhode_Island] neighborhood of College
Hill. The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block
bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets [/wiki/Thayer_Street];
newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core,
historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three
greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J.
Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[58][59] A brick and
wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's
perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian
[/wiki/Georgian_architecture] and Richardsonian Romanesque
[/wiki/Richardsonian_Romanesque] in its architectural character.[58]

To the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential
quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately
to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of
Engineering [/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Engineering]. North of the central
campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the
Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing
the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries,
the John Hay Library [/wiki/John_Hay_Library] and the John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Library [/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller_Jr._Library].

The university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of
Design [/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design], which is located immediately to
Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.

Van Wickle Gates [/wiki/Van_Wickle_Gates] stand at the crest of College Hill
[/wiki/College_Hill,_Providence,_Rhode_Island]

Built in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gates that stand
at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main gate is flanked by two
smaller side gates. At Convocation the central gate opens inward to admit the
procession of new students; at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the
procession of graduates.[60] A Brown superstition holds that students who walk
through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although
walking backward is said to cancel the hex.

John Hay Library [/wiki/John_Hay_Library] is home to rare books, special
collections, and the university archives.

The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus.[61] Opened in 1910,
the library is named for John Hay [/wiki/John_Hay] (class of 1858), private
secretary to Abraham Lincoln [/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln] and Secretary of State
under William McKinley [/wiki/William_McKinley] and Theodore Roosevelt
[/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt]. The construction of the building was funded in large
part by Hay's friend, Andrew Carnegie [/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie], who contributed
half of the $300,000 cost of construction.[62]

The John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university's archives, rare
books and manuscripts, and special collections. Noteworthy among the latter are
the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection
[/wiki/Anne_S._K._Brown_Military_Collection][63] (described as "the foremost
American collection of material devoted to the history and iconography of
soldiers and soldiering"),[64] the Harris Collection of American Poetry and
Plays (described as "the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind
in any research library"), the Lownes Collection of the History of Science
(described as "one of the three most important private collections of books of
science in America"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft [/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft].
The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of incunabula
[/wiki/Incunable] in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios
[/wiki/First_Folio], the manuscript of George Orwell [/wiki/George_Orwell]'s
Nineteen Eighty-Four [/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four], and three books bound in

colonial Americas [/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas].[66]

Founded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the
world's leading collection of primary historical sources relating to the
exploration and colonization of the Americas. While administered and funded
separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brown and located
on its campus since 1904.[67]

The library contains the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the
Bay Psalm Book [/wiki/Bay_Psalm_Book]—the earliest extant book printed in
British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world.[68]
Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio [/wiki/First_Folio] and the
world's largest collection of 16th-century Mexican texts.[69]

Main article: Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology
[/wiki/Haffenreffer_Museum_of_Anthropology]

The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's
teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one
million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located
at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island
[/wiki/Bristol,_Rhode_Island].[70] The museum's goal is to inspire creative and
critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding
of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to
work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in
classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas
of anthropology and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.


ANNMARY BROWN MEMORIAL

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=15]]
Main article: Annmary Brown Memorial [/wiki/Annmary_Brown_Memorial]

The Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician,
Civil War veteran, and book collector General Rush Hawkins [/wiki/Rush_Hawkins],
as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In
addition to its crypt—the final repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial
includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by
Angelica Kauffman [/wiki/Angelica_Kauffman], Peter Paul Rubens
[/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens], Gilbert Stuart [/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart], Giovanni
Battista Tiepolo [/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo], Benjamin West
[/wiki/Benjamin_West], and Eastman Johnson [/wiki/Eastman_Johnson], among
others. His collection of over 450 incunabula [/wiki/Incunable] was relocated to
the John Hay Library in 1990.[71] Today the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval
Studies [/wiki/Medieval_studies] and Renaissance Studies
[/wiki/Renaissance_studies] programs.


THE WALK

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=16]]

The Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the
main campus. It runs parallel to Thayer Street [/wiki/Thayer_Street] and serves
as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle at its
southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at its
northern end.[72][73] The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as
the Lindemann Performing Arts Center [/wiki/Lindemann_Performing_Arts_Center]
and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts
[/wiki/Perry_and_Marty_Granoff_Center_for_the_Creative_Arts]

The corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin
[/wiki/Maya_Lin] and Tom Friedman [/wiki/Tom_Friedman_(artist)].[74]


PEMBROKE CAMPUS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=17]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Brown_University_Pembroke_campus.jpg/220px-Brown_University_Pembroke_campus.jpg]/wiki/File:Brown_University_Pembroke_campus.jpgThree
dormitories, Metcalf Hall (1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and Miller Hall (1910),
formed the heart of Pembroke College and now serve as freshman residences.

The Women's College in Brown University
[/wiki/Pembroke_College_in_Brown_University], known as Pembroke College, was
founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown
University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The
Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and
sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by
brick architecture, largely of the Georgian [/wiki/Georgian_architecture] and
Victorian styles [/wiki/Victorian_architecture]. The west side of the quadrangle
comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall
(1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall
(1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).

East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the
campus of Bryant University [/wiki/Bryant_University]. In 1969, as Bryant was
preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island
[/wiki/Smithfield,_Rhode_Island], Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5
million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and
26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[75] Today, the area
is largely used for dormitories.

Thayer Street [/wiki/Thayer_Street] runs through Brown's main campus. As a
commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard
Square [/wiki/Harvard_Square] or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue
[/wiki/Telegraph_Avenue]. Wickenden Street [/wiki/Wickenden_Street], in the
adjacent Fox Point [/wiki/Fox_Point,_Providence,_Rhode_Island] neighborhood, is
another commercial street similarly popular among students.

Built in 1925, Brown Stadium [/wiki/Brown_Stadium]—the home of the school's
football team—is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the
university's central campus.[76] Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew
teams, lies on the Seekonk River [/wiki/Seekonk_River], to the southeast of
campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion
at the Edgewood Yacht Club [/wiki/Edgewood_Yacht_Club] in adjacent Cranston
[/wiki/Cranston,_Rhode_Island].

Since 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in
Providence's historic Jewelry District [/wiki/Jewelry_District_(Providence)],
near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital
[/wiki/Rhode_Island_Hospital] and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island
[/wiki/Women_%26_Infants_Hospital_of_Rhode_Island]. Other university facilities,
including molecular medicine [/wiki/Molecular_medicine] labs and administrative
offices, are likewise located in the area.[77][78]

Brown's School of Public Health [/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Public_Health]
occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River
[/wiki/Providence_River]. Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2)
Mount Hope Grant [/wiki/Mount_Hope_(Rhode_Island)] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an
important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War
[/wiki/King_Philip%27s_War]. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology
[/wiki/Haffenreffer_Museum_of_Anthropology] Collection Research Center,
particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope
Grant.


SUSTAINABILITY

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=18]]

Brown has committed to "minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental
impacts, and promote environmental stewardship."[79] Since 2010, the university
has required all new buildings meet LEED silver
[/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design] standards.[80] Between
2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions
[/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions] by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction
is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted
its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered
system.[81]

In 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel
[/wiki/Fossil_fuel] investments as part of a broader divestment from direct
investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels
[/wiki/Fossil_fuels].[82] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing
quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon
neutrality [/wiki/Carbon_neutrality] by 2040.[83] Brown is a member of the Ivy
Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice
sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with
other member institutions.[84]

According to the A. W. Kuchler [/wiki/A._W._Kuchler] U.S. potential natural
vegetation [/wiki/Potential_natural_vegetation] types, Brown would have a
dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak [/wiki/Oak] (104) with a dominant
vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood [/wiki/Hardwood] Forest (25).[85]


ACADEMICS

Hall (1878) was designed by Walker and Gould [/wiki/William_R._Walker_%26_Son]
in the Venetian Gothic [/wiki/Venetian_Gothic_architecture] style to house
Brown's library.

Founded in 1764, The College is Brown's oldest school. About 7,200 undergraduate
students are enrolled in the college [when?
[/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items]], and 81
concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the most popular
concentrations were Computer Science, Economics, Biology, History, Applied
Mathematics, International Relations, and Political Science. A quarter of Brown
undergraduates complete more than one concentration before graduating.[86] If
the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular interests,
undergraduates may design and pursue independent concentrations.[87]

Around 35 percent [needs update
[/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items]] of
undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent
within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years.[88] For the Class of 2009, 56
percent of all undergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among
undergraduate alumni who go on to receive graduate degrees, the most common
degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%), M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D.
(11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earn
graduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University
[/wiki/Columbia_University], and Harvard University
[/wiki/Harvard_University].[89]

The highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after
graduation are education and higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and
finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and technology (7%).[89]


BROWN AND RISD

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=21]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/List_Art_Center%2C_Brown_University.jpg/250px-List_Art_Center%2C_Brown_University.jpg]/wiki/File:List_Art_Center,_Brown_University.jpgThe
List Art Center, built 1969–71, designed by Philip Johnson
[/wiki/Philip_Johnson], houses Brown's Department of Visual Art and the David
Winton Bell Gallery [/wiki/David_Winton_Bell_Gallery].

Since its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School of Design
[/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design] (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west.
Since 1900, Brown and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two
institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at
RISD to count towards their Brown degree.[90] The two institutions partner to
provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a
synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.

DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=22]]

After several years of discussion between the two institutions and several
students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established
a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in
the fall of 2008.[91] The Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most
selective in the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the
class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.[92] The program
combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio
art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are admitted to
the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both
the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and
the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must
apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions
committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown|RISD joint
committee.

[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Granoff_Center_%28Brown%29.jpg/220px-Granoff_Center_%28Brown%29.jpg]/wiki/File:Granoff_Center_(Brown).jpgThe
Granoff Center [/wiki/Perry_and_Marty_Granoff_Center_for_the_Creative_Arts],
designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro [/wiki/Diller_Scofidio_%2B_Renfro], hosts
the annual Brown|RISD Dual Degree exhibition.

Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its
first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum while taking up to
three Brown classes. Students spend their second year in residence at Brown,
during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD
major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to
live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by
the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and
RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original
approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial
design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or
philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual "BRDD
Exhibition" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest
and attendees from the broader world of industry, design, the media, and the
fine arts.

MADE PROGRAM

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=23]]

In 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of
Arts in Design Engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to
combine RISD's programs in industrial design with Brown's programs in
engineering. The program is administered through Brown's School of Engineering
and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.[93]


THEATRE AND PLAYWRITING

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=24]]

Hall, built 1890–92, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance
Studies.

Brown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the
country.[94][95] Six Brown graduates have received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama
[/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Drama]; Alfred Uhry [/wiki/Alfred_Uhry] '58, Lynn
Nottage [/wiki/Lynn_Nottage] '86, Ayad Akhtar [/wiki/Ayad_Akhtar] '93, Nilo Cruz

'04, and Jackie Sibblies Drury [/wiki/Jackie_Sibblies_Drury] MFA '04.[96] In
American Theater [/wiki/Theatre_Communications_Group] magazine's 2009 ranking of
the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five
places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl [/wiki/Sarah_Ruhl]
'97, and Stephen Karam [/wiki/Stephen_Karam] '02.[97][98]

The undergraduate concentration encompasses programs in theatre history,
performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech,
and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs
are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and
directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA program,
which partners with the Trinity Repertory Company
[/wiki/Trinity_Repertory_Company], a local regional theatre
[/wiki/Regional_theater_in_the_United_States].[99]

WRITING PROGRAMS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=25]]

Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting,
electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency
requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty
that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The
undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry,
screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include
the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department and
the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies
department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English
department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the
departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate
writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.

AUTHOR PRIZEWINNERS

Brown Computing Laboratory, designed by Philip Johnson [/wiki/Philip_Johnson]

Brown began offering computer science courses through the departments of
Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown
added an IBM 650 [/wiki/IBM_650] in January 1958, the only one of its type
between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer
building, the Brown University Computing Laboratory
[/wiki/Brown_University_Computing_Laboratory]. The facility, designed by Philip
Johnson [/wiki/Philip_Johnson], received an IBM 7070 [/wiki/IBM_7070] computer
the following year. The first undergraduate Computer Science degrees were
awarded in 1974. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in
1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by
teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England
region.[102]

In the 1960s, Andries van Dam [/wiki/Andries_van_Dam], along with Ted Nelson
[/wiki/Ted_Nelson] and Bob Wallace [/wiki/Bob_Wallace_(computer_scientist)]
invented The Hypertext Editing Systems [/wiki/Hypertext_Editing_System], HES

Between 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled.[106] In 2017,
computer science overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate
concentration.[107]


APPLIED MATHEMATICS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=28]]

Brown's program in applied mathematics [/wiki/Applied_mathematics] was
established in 1941 making it the oldest such program in the United
States.[9][108] The division is highly ranked and regarded nationally.[109]
Among the 67 recipients of the Timoshenko Medal [/wiki/Timoshenko_Medal], 22

Main article: Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World
[/wiki/Joukowsky_Institute_for_Archaeology_and_the_Ancient_World]

Established in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient
World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for archeology and ancient
studies. The institute pursues fieldwork, excavations, regional surveys, and
academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt,
and Western Asia from the Levant [/wiki/Levant] to the Caucasus
[/wiki/Caucasus].[110] The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with
faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra [/wiki/Petra]
(Jordan), Abydos [/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt] (Egypt), Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico,
Guatemala, Montserrat [/wiki/Montserrat], and Providence.

The Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the
departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of
Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and
Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious
architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and
the archaeology of the Caucasus [/wiki/Caucasus]. The institute offers visiting
teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years,
included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology
[/wiki/Classical_archaeology] and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and
Archaeology and Media Studies.

Egyptology and Assyriology

Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of
Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments
of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such
departments in the United States.[111] The curricular focus is on three
principal areas: Egyptology [/wiki/Egyptology], Assyriology [/wiki/Assyriology],
and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and
mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown
undergraduates without prerequisites and include archaeology, languages,
history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions
[/wiki/Ancient_Mesopotamian_religion], literature, and science. Students
concentrating in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or
Assyriology. Graduate-level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree:
Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.

Brown University Engineering Research Center, completed in 2018 and designed by
KieranTimberlake [/wiki/KieranTimberlake][121]

Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League
and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country.[g] In 1916,
Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged
into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was elevated to a
School of Engineering.[122]

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is organized
without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools and
follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine,
physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences.
The school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers
team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.

Student teams have launched two CubeSats [/wiki/CubeSat] with the support of the
School of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developed EQUiSat [/wiki/EQUiSat]
a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team developed SBUDNIC
[/wiki/SBUDNIC] a 3U satellite.[123][124]


IE BROWN EXECUTIVE MBA DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=32]]

Since 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one
of the leading Business Schools in Europe, IE Business School
[/wiki/IE_Business_School] in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened
resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[125] In this
partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of
the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to
other Ivy League's EMBAs.[126] The cohort typically consists of 25–30 EMBA
candidates from some 20 countries.[127] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid
[/wiki/Madrid], Cape Town [/wiki/Cape_Town] and Online.

The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown
in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott [/wiki/Joan_Wallach_Scott] as an interdisciplinary
research center on gender.[128] The center is named for Pembroke College,
Brown's former women's college, and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle
Women's Center [/wiki/Sarah_Doyle_Women%27s_Center]. The Pembroke Center
supports Brown's undergraduate concentration in Gender and Sexuality Studies

Brown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted its first advanced
degrees in 1888. The university established a Graduate Department in 1903 and a
full Graduate School in 1927.[129]

With an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the school currently offers
33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs, respectively. The school additionally
offers a number of fifth-year master's programs.[130] Overall, admission to the
Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging at
approximately 9 percent in recent years.


CARNEY INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN SCIENCE

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=35]]
Main article: Carney Institute for Brain Science
[/wiki/Carney_Institute_for_Brain_Science]

The Robert J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science is Brown's
cross-departmental neuroscience research institute [/wiki/Research_institute].
The institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces
[/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface] and computational neuroscience
[/wiki/Computational_neuroscience]; additional areas of focus include research
into mechanisms of cell death [/wiki/Cell_death] with the interest of developing
therapies for neurodegenerative diseases [/wiki/Neurodegeneration].

The Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue
[/wiki/John_Donoghue_(neuroscientist)] in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain
Science and renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift.[131] The
donation, one of the largest in the university's history, established the
institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscience programs in the
country.[132]

Alpert Medical School [/wiki/Alpert_Medical_School] building on Richmond Street

Established in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth oldest medical
school in the Ivy League.[11][h]

In 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis Wayland
[/wiki/Francis_Wayland] after the program's faculty declined to follow a new
policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in
1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a
graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially
renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown
Medical School in October 2000.[133] In January 2007, entrepreneur and
philanthropist Warren Alpert [/wiki/Warren_Alpert] donated $100 million to the
school. In recognition of the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren
Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

In 2020, U.S. News & World Report [/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report] ranked
Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance
rate of 2.8%.[134] U.S. News ranks the school 38th for research and 35th for
primary care.[135]

Brown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal
Medical Education [/wiki/Program_in_Liberal_Medical_Education] (PLME), an
eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the
program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the
country, offering admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[136]

Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island
residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence
College [/wiki/Providence_College], Rhode Island College
[/wiki/Rhode_Island_College], the University of Rhode Island
[/wiki/University_of_Rhode_Island], and Tougaloo College
[/wiki/Tougaloo_College]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept
applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via
AMCAS [/wiki/AMCAS] like most other medical schools. The medical school also
offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. [/wiki/Master_of_Public_Health] and M.D./M.P.P.
[/wiki/Master_of_Public_Policy] dual degree programs.

Brown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert Medical School's
Department of Community Health and was officially founded in 2013 as an
independent school.[137][138] The school issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.),
graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M., A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees
(M.P.H./M.P.A., M.D./M.P.H.).[139]


ONLINE PROGRAMS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=38]]

The Brown University School of Professional Studies currently offers blended
learning [/wiki/Blended_learning] Executive master's degrees in Healthcare
Leadership [/wiki/Health_administration], Cyber Security, and Science and
Technology Leadership.[140] The master's degrees are designed to help students
who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in their respective
fields. The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a weekly seminar
each trimester.

The university has also invested in MOOC [/wiki/MOOC] development starting in
2013, when two courses, Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets and The Fiction of
Relationship, both of which received thousands of students.[141] However, after
a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera
[/wiki/Coursera] and revamped its online persona and MOOC development
department. By 2017, the university released new courses on edx [/wiki/EdX], two
of which were The Ethics of Memory and Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich
Patient Care. In January 2018, Brown published its first "game-ified" course
called Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature,
which featured out-of-platform games to help learners understand materials, as
well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help
characters along their journey.[142]

In 2014, Brown tied with the University of Connecticut
[/wiki/University_of_Connecticut] for the highest number of reported rapes in
the nation, with its "total of reports of rape" on their main campus standing at
43.[186] However, such rankings have been criticized for failing to account for
how different campus environments can encourage or discourage individuals from
reporting sexual assault cases, thereby affecting the number of reported
rapes.[187]

RESIDENTIAL AND GREEK SOCIETIES

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=47]]

Approximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in Greek Life
[/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities].[193] The university recognizes thirteen
active Greek organizations. Since the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on
campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.[194]


SOCIETIES AND CLUBS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=48]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Ladd_Observatory2.jpg/250px-Ladd_Observatory2.jpg]/wiki/File:Ladd_Observatory2.jpgLadd
Observatory [/wiki/Ladd_Observatory], built 1890–1891, is used by Brown Space
Engineering, a student group focused on aerospace engineering
[/wiki/Aerospace_engineering].

The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The
Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne
[/wiki/Solomon_Drowne], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[12]
The organization seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War
[/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War]. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian
Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian
Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society
(1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as
academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large
libraries.[195][196] Older societies generally aligned with Federalists
[/wiki/Federalist_Party] while younger societies generally leaned Republican
[/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)].[12]

Societies remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely
replaced by fraternities.[196]

The Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that "tapped" 15 seniors
each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by
the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the de facto
undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and
ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.

Societas Domi Pacificae [/wiki/Societas_Domi_Pacificae], known colloquially as
"Pacifica House", is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a
continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed
intermediary "Franklin Society" traceable in the nineteenth century.

Sarah Doyle Women's Center [/wiki/Sarah_Doyle_Women%27s_Center]

Brown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources
of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of
their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for
students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused,
some provide academic support as well.

The Brown Center for Students of Color
[/wiki/Brown_Center_for_Students_of_Color] (BCSC) is a space that provides
support for students of color [/wiki/People_of_color]. Established in 1972 at
the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in
critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote social justice
[/wiki/Social_justice].[198] The center houses various programs for students to
share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World
Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series,
and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster
community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet
and study.

The Sarah Doyle Women's Center [/wiki/Sarah_Doyle_Women%27s_Center] aims to
provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues
surrounding gender [/wiki/Gender].[199] The center was named after one of the
first women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle [/wiki/Sarah_Doyle]. The center
emphasizes intersectionality [/wiki/Intersectionality] in its conversations on
gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various
aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate
dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.[200]

Other centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation
College and Low-Income Student (U-FLi) Center,[201] and the Curricular Resource
Center.


ACTIVISM

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=52]]

1968 BLACK STUDENT WALKOUT

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=53]]

On December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a
walkout in protest of an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students
as a "stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students" after
feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black
students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase
Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match
that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in
Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be
met.[202][203]

DIVESTMENT FROM SOUTH AFRICA

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=54]]

In the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain
companies involved in South Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with
partial divestment and began a fast in Manning Chapel and the university
disenrolled them. In April 1987, "dozens" of students interrupted a university
corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.[204]

PROTEST OF SPEECH BY NYPD COMMISSIONER RAY KELLY

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=55]]

In 2013, students and Providence community members protested and disrupted a
speech [/wiki/Protest_of_Ray_Kelly_at_Brown_University] by then-NYPD
Commissioner Raymond Kelly [/wiki/Raymond_Kelly]. The incident was cited by Greg
Lukianoff [/wiki/Greg_Lukianoff], president of the Foundation for Individual
Rights and Expression [/wiki/Foundation_for_Individual_Rights_and_Expression],
as a high-profile example of a form of student protest questioning conceptions
of free speech.[205] The incident was also the subject of a short critical
documentary in 2016 by Brown alumnus Rob Montz.[206]

ISRAEL-GAZA PROTESTS

[edit [/w/index.php?title=Brown_University&action=edit&section=56]]

In early November 2023, twenty students of Jewish background staged a sit in at
University hall, resulting in their arrests. The students were protesting the
Gaza war [/wiki/Gaza_war] and calling for a ceasefire, as well as for the
university to divest from companies that "facilitate the 'Israeli military
occupation' in Gaza." In early December 2023, forty-one more students held a
sit-in with similar demands, resulting in more arrests by the university.
Nineteen students participated in an eight-day hunger strike preceding a
corporation meeting in early February 2024 with the demand to present their case
to corporation members.[207]
