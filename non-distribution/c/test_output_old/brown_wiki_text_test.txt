Brown University
Brown University is a private Ivy League research
university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. It
is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in
the US, founded in 1764 as the College in the English
Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the
American Revolution,[7] it was the first US college to
codify that admission and instruction of students was to
be equal regardless of the religious affiliation of
students.[8]
The university is home to the oldest applied
mathematics program in the country and oldest
engineering program in the Ivy League.[a][9][10][11] It
was one of the early doctoral-granting institutions in the
U.S., adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[12] In
1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after student
lobbying, which eliminated mandatory general
education distribution requirements.[13][14] In 1971,
Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke
College, was fully merged into the university.
The university comprises the College, the Graduate
School, Alpert Medical School, the School of
Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School
of Professional Studies. Its international programs are
organized through the Watson Institute for
International and Public Affairs, and it is academically
affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the
Rhode Island School of Design, which offers
undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.
Brown's main campus is in the College Hill
neighborhood of Providence. The university is
surrounded by a federally listed architectural district
with a concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit
Street has one of America's richest concentrations of
17th- and 18th-century architecture.[15][16]
Undergraduate admissions are among the most
selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 5%
for the class of 2026.[17][18]

Petitioner Ezra Stiles later
became the seventh
president of Yale  C ollege.
Petitioner William Ellery
signed the United States
Declaration of
Independence in 1776.
As of March 2022, 11 Nobel Prize winners, 1 Fields
Medalist, 7 National Humanities Medalists,[b] and 11
National Medal of Science laureates have been affiliated
with Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers. Alumni
also include 27 Pulitzer Prize winners,[c] 21
billionaires,[d] 4 U.S. Secretaries of State, over 100
members of the United States Congress,[25] 58 Rhodes
Scholars,[26] 22 MacArthur Genius Fellows,[e] and 38
Olympic medalists.[27]
In 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island,
drafted a petition to the colony's General
Assembly:[28]
That your Petitioners propose to open a
literary institution or School for
instructing young Gentlemen in the
Languages, Mathematics, Geography &
History, & such other branches of
Knowledge as shall be desired. That for
this End... it will be necessary... to erect
a public Building or Buildings for the
boarding of the youth & the Residence
of the Professors.
The three petitioners were Ezra Stiles, pastor of
Newport's Second Congregational Church and future president of Yale University; William Ellery Jr.,
future signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; and Josias Lyndon, future governor of
the colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The
editor of Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr.
Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown
University."[28][29][12]
The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches was also interested in establishing a college in
Rhode Island, which was home of the mother church of their denomination. At the time, the Baptists
were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard University and
Yale University, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey, which later became Princeton
University, and the Episcopalians had the College of William & Mary and King's College, which later
became Columbia University. The local University of Pennsylvania in their native Philadelphia was

Brown's ﬁrst president,
minister James Manning
The Ezra Stiles copy of
Brown's 1764 charter
founded by Benjamin Franklin without direct association with any particular denomination.[30] Isaac
Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the
October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:[12]
The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring
them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony
of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning, who took
his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in
this important work.
James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the
charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected
by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College
Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island
General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.[31]
In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the
corporation—the college's governing body—was
held in Newport's Old Colony House. Governor
Stephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former
and future governor Samuel Ward vice
chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and
Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated
that the board of trustees should be composed of
22 Baptists, five Quakers, five Episcopalians, and
four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight
should be Baptists—including the college
president—"and the rest indifferently of any or
all Denominations."[12]
At the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a
uniquely progressive document.[32] Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing
doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part
of the Public and Classical Instruction." The document additionally "recognized more broadly and
fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation."[12]
The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College
membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.[33]
The college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First Baptist Church in Warren,
Rhode Island.[34] Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the
role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to
"solicit Benefactions for this Institution".[33] During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles,
Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.[33]

Following the gift of Nicholas Brown
Jr. ( C lass of 1786), the university
was renamed in his honor.
In 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To
establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre
lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority
of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of
Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original
proprietors of Providence Plantations.[35] After the college was
relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.
A building committee, organized by the corporation, developed
plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design
on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as "The
College Edifice" and later as University Hall, may have been
modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New
Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building
process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble
that of his alma mater.[36]
Nicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown
were instrumental in moving the college to Providence,
constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph
became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John
served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son
Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to
1825.[37]
On September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, "That the donation
of $5,000, if made to this College within one Year from the late
Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." The
following year, the appeal was answered by College Treasurer
Nicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown
committed "a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island
College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of
a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters." In recognition of
the gift, the corporation on the same day voted, "That this College
be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown
University."[38] Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and
included funds for building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).
In 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library
on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of
Nicholas Brown Jr.
The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both
directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of
slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent

abolitionists.
In 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering
committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address
them.[39]
With British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out
of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's
University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George
Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to
the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the
defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from
December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May
27, 1782.[12]
A number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequent
founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the
Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James
Manning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving
as Brown's first president.[40] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed
the Declaration of Independence.
James Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General
George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of
the entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode
Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[41] David Howell,
who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to
1785.
Nineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012,
Christina Hull Paxson has served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of Princeton
University's School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economics
department.[42] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first African
American president of an Ivy League institution.[43] Other presidents of note include academic,
Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland.
In 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80
students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools,
especially San Francisco State College, and sought ways to "put students at the center of their
education" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts".[44]

American president.
Brown's 19th
President,  C hristina

in the role since
2012.
Members of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwell
published a paper of their findings titled, "Draft of a
Working Paper for Education at Brown
University."[45][44] The paper made proposals for a new
curriculum, including interdisciplinary freshman-year
courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with
instruction from faculty from different disciplines as
well as for an end to letter grades. The following year
Magaziner began organizing the student body to press
for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.[46]
In 1968, university president Ray Heffner established a
Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed
of administrators, the committee was tasked with
developing specific reforms and producing
recommendations. A report, produced by the
committee, was presented to the faculty, which voted
the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its
key features included:[47]
Modes of Thought courses for ﬁrst-year students
The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
The abandonment of "general education" distribution
requirements
The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option
The ABC/No Credit grading system, which
eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of "No
Credit" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would
not appear on external transcripts.
The Modes of Thought course was discontinued early
on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the
reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation.
The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and
students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[48]
In 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown's
eighteenth-century ties to slavery. In October 2006, the committee released a report documenting its
findings.[49][50]
Titled "Slavery and Justice", the document detailed the ways in which the university benefited both
directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade and the labor of enslaved people. The report
also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this legacy.[51] Brown has
since completed a number of these recommendations including the establishment of its Center for the
Study of Slavery and Justice, the construction of its Slavery Memorial, and the funding of a $10
million permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools.[51][52]

Landmark

eastern edge of Brown's campus.
The "Slavery and Justice" report marked the first major effort by an American university to address its
ties to slavery and prompted other institutions to undertake similar processes.[53][54]
Brown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis Wayland had
commissioned a committee to update the school's original seal to match the name the university had
adopted in 1804. Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon divided into four sectors by a red
cross. Within each sector of the coat of arms lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of
the upper half of a sun in splendor among the clouds atop a red and white torse.[55]
Brown is the largest institutional landowner in
Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the
Jewelry District.[56] The university was built
contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-
century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's
campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban
fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped
Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip
Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and
Robert A. M. Stern.[57]
Brown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and 143
acres (0.58 km2) in the East Side neighborhood of
College Hill. The university's central campus sits on a
15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman,
Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings
extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's
core, historic campus, constructed primary between
1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or
Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth
J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln
Field).[58][59] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the
block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its
architectural character.[58]
To the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including
Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences
Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts

facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic
buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the
John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.
The university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located
immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.
Built in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gates
that stand at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main
gate is flanked by two smaller side gates. At Convocation the
central gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students;
at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of
graduates.[60] A Brown superstition holds that students who walk
through the central gate a second time prematurely will not
graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.
The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus.[61]
Opened in 1910, the library is named for John Hay (class of 1858),
private secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under
William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The construction of
the building was funded in large part by Hay's friend, Andrew
Carnegie, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of
construction.[62]
The John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university's
archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections.
Noteworthy among the latter are the Anne S. K. Brown Military
Collection[63] (described as "the foremost American collection of
material devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and
soldiering"),[64] the Harris Collection of American Poetry and
Plays (described as "the largest and most comprehensive collection
of its kind in any research library"), the Lownes Collection of the
History of Science (described as "one of the three most important private collections of books of
science in America"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft. The Hay Library is home to one of the
broadest collections of incunabula in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios, the
manuscript of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and three books bound in human skin.[65]
Founded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the world's leading
collection of primary historical sources relating to the exploration and colonization of the Americas.
While administered and funded separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brown
and located on its campus since 1904.[67]

one of the world's leading
repositories of books, maps, and
manuscripts relating to the colonial
Americas.[66]
The galleries of Brown's
anthropology museum, the
Haffenreffer, are located in Manning
Hall.
The library contains the best preserved of the eleven surviving
copies of the Bay Psalm Book—the earliest extant book printed in
British North America and the most expensive printed book in the
world.[68] Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio and
the world's largest collection of 16th-century Mexican texts.[69]
The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of
Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning
Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts,
available for research and educational purposes, are located at its
Collections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island.[70] The
museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about
culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the
material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students
to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects
and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum
sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology and also
runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.
The Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907
by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General
Rush Hawkins, as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a
member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the final
repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works
of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by
Angelica Kauffman, Peter Paul Rubens, Gilbert Stuart, Giovanni
Battista Tiepolo, Benjamin West, and Eastman Johnson, among
others. His collection of over 450 incunabula was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.[71] Today
the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.
The Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It
runs parallel to Thayer Street and serves as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth Simmons
Quadrangle at its southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at its
northern end.[72][73] The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as the Lindemann
Performing Arts Center and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts
The corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Friedman.[74]

Three dormitories, Metcalf Hall
(1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and
Miller Hall (1910), formed the heart
of Pembroke  C ollege and now serve
as freshman residences.
The Women's College in Brown University, known as Pembroke
College, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with
the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was
absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is
bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits
three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is
dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and
Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises
Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf
Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927)
and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north
with Andrews Hall (1947).
East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant
University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown
purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10
acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[75] Today, the
area is largely used for dormitories.
Thayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students,
Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the
adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.
Built in 1925, Brown Stadium—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately a
mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[76] Marston Boathouse, the home of
Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are
based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.
Since 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry
District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the
Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular
medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[77][78]
Brown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River.
Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island,
an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer
Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is
located in the Mount Hope Grant.
Brown has committed to "minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and
promote environmental stewardship."[79] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings
meet LEED silver standards.[80] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by

27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project
which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered
system.[81]
In 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader
divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[82] In 2021, the
university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and
achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[83] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability
Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of
campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[84]
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant
vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (104) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood
Forest (25).[85]
Founded in 1764, The College is Brown's oldest school. About
7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college , and 81
concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the
most popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics,
Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations,
and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduates
complete more than one concentration before graduating.[86] If
the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular
interests, undergraduates may design and pursue independent
concentrations.[87]
Around 35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate or
professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80
percent within 10 years.[88] For the Class of 2009, 56 percent of all
undergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among undergraduate alumni who go on
to receive graduate degrees, the most common degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%),
M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D. (11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earn
graduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University, and Harvard University.[89]
The highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after graduation are education
and higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and
technology (7%).[89]

exhibition.
Since its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School of
Design (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brown
and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two
institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as
four courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree.[90] The
two institutions partner to provide various student-life services
and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill
cultural scene.
After several years of discussion between the two institutions and
several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and
RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in
2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.[91] The
Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in
the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the
class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.[92]
The program combines the complementary strengths of the two
institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are
admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the
Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts
(B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be
accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third
Brown|RISD joint committee.
Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD
completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies
curriculum while taking up to three Brown classes. Students spend
their second year in residence at Brown, during which students
take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major
requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can
elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution
is determined by the requirements of each student's unique
combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program
participants are noted for their creative and original approach to
cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example,
industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with
human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with
urban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized
and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the broader world of industry,
design, the media, and the fine arts.

In 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of Arts in Design
Engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to combine RISD's programs in
industrial design with Brown's programs in engineering. The program is administered through
Brown's School of Engineering and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.[93]
Brown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-
regarded in the country.[94][95] Six Brown graduates have received
the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; Alfred Uhry '58, Lynn Nottage '86,
Ayad Akhtar '93, Nilo Cruz '94, Quiara Alegría Hudes '04, and
Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04.[96] In American Theater
magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays,
Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter
Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen
Karam '02.[97][98]
The undergraduate concentration encompasses programs in
theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy,
acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production.
Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate
School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity
Rep MFA program, which partners with the Trinity Repertory Company, a local regional theatre.[99]
Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting,
screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the
undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by
various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long
included nationally and internationally known authors. The
undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in
fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and
translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry
MFA writing programs in the literary arts department and the
MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance
studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department.
Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and
modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the
Writing Center.

Brown began offering computer science courses through the
departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956
when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an IBM 650 in
January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and
Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer
building, the Brown University Computing Laboratory. The
facility, designed by Philip Johnson, received an IBM 7070
computer the following year. The first undergraduate Computer
Science degrees were awarded in 1974. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in
1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops
standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.[102]
In the 1960s, Andries van Dam, along with Ted Nelson and Bob Wallace invented The Hypertext
Editing Systems, HES and FRESS while at Brown. Nelson coined the word hypertext while Van Dam's
students helped originate XML, XSLT, and related Web standards. Among the school's computer
science alumni are principal architect of the Classic Mac OS, Andy Hertzfeld; principal architect of the
Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 microprocessors, John Crawford; former CEO of Apple, John Sculley;
and digital effects programmer Masi Oka.[103][104] Other alumni include former CS department head
at MIT, John Guttag; software-defined networking pioneer Scott Shenker; Workday founder, Aneel
Bhusri; MongoDB founder Eliot Horowitz; Figma founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace (the latter
of whom also created esbuild); OpenSea founder Devin Finzer; and Edward D. Lazowska, professor
and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Chair emeritus at the University of Washington.[105]
Between 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled.[106] In 2017, computer science
overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate concentration.[107]

Wilbour Hall is named for
Egyptologist  C harles Edwin Wilbour
(class of 1854).
Brown's program in applied mathematics was established in 1941 making it the oldest such program
in the United States.[9][108] The division is highly ranked and regarded nationally.[109] Among the 67
recipients of the Timoshenko Medal, 22 have been affiliated with Brown's applied mathematics
division as faculty, researchers, or students.[f]
Established in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and
the Ancient World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for
archeology and ancient studies. The institute pursues fieldwork,
excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the
archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and
Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus.[110] The institute
has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations
and regional surveys presently in Petra (Jordan), Abydos (Egypt),
Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat, and
Providence.
The Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments
from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics,
Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty
research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and
architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious
architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean
Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The institute
offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships
which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology
and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and
Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.
Egyptology and Assyriology
Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the
Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments of
Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United
States.[111] The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of
the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department
are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisites and include archaeology, languages,
history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating in
the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate-level study comprises
three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in
Antiquity.

The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown's
center for the study of global Issues and public affairs, is one of
the leading institutes of its type in the country. The institute
occupies facilities designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly
and Japanese architect Toshiko Mori. The institute was initially
endowed by Thomas Watson Jr. (Class of 1937), former
Ambassador to the Soviet Union and longtime president of IBM.
Institute faculty and faculty emeritus include Italian prime
minister and European Commission president Romano Prodi,[112]
Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso,[113] Chilean
president Ricardo Lagos Escobar,[114] Mexican novelist and
statesman Carlos Fuentes,[115] Brazilian statesman and United
Nations commission head Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro,[116] Indian
foreign minister and ambassador to the United States Nirupama
Rao,[117] American diplomat and Dayton Peace Accords author
Richard Holbrooke (Class of 1962),[118] and Sergei
Khrushchev,[119] editor of the papers of his father Nikita
Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union.
The institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal
themes of development, security, and governance—with further
focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and
poverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: Development
Studies, International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and Caribbean
Studies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies.  G raduate programs offered at
the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public
Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development, and global
outreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, including
the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies Center, The Center
for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In
recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its Costs of War
Project, first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team of
economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate
the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan since 2001.[120]
Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest
civilian engineering program in the country.[g] In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical,
and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was
elevated to a School of Engineering.[122]

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is
organized without the traditional departments or boundaries
found at most schools and follows a model of connectivity between
disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry,
computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. The
school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which
engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of
ideas.
Student teams have launched two CubeSats with the support of the
School of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developed
EQUiSat a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team
developed SBUDNIC a 3U satellite.[123][124]
Since 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading
Business Schools in Europe, IE Business School in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened
resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[125] In this partnership, Brown provides
its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a
differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[126] The cohort typically consists of
25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[127] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape
Town and Online.
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was
established at Brown in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott as an
interdisciplinary research center on gender.[128] The center is
named for Pembroke College, Brown's former women's college,
and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle Women's Center. The
Pembroke Center supports Brown's undergraduate concentration
in Gender and Sexuality Studies, post-doctoral research
fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic
programs. It also manages various collections, archives, and
resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers
and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.
Brown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted its
first advanced degrees in 1888. The university established a
Graduate Department in 1903 and a full Graduate School in 1927.[129]

With an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the school
currently offers 33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs,
respectively. The school additionally offers a number of fifth-year
master's programs.[130] Overall, admission to the Graduate School
is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging at
approximately 9 percent in recent years.
The Robert J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science is
Brown's cross-departmental neuroscience research institute. The
institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces and
computational neuroscience; additional areas of focus include research into mechanisms of cell death
with the interest of developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
The Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain Science
and renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift.[131] The donation, one of the largest in the
university's history, established the institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscience
programs in the country.[132]
Established in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth
oldest medical school in the Ivy League.[11][h]
In 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis
Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a new
policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was
reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program
in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in
1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown
University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown
Medical School in October 2000.[133] In January 2007,
entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of
the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the
country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%.[134] U.S. News ranks the school 38th for research and 35th
for primary care.[135]
Brown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education
(PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the
program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering
admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[136]

Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue
careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the
University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to accept
applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most other
medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree
programs.
Brown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert Medical
School's Department of Community Health and was officially
founded in 2013 as an independent school.[137][138] The school
issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.), graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M.,
A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees (M.P.H./M.P.A.,
M.D./M.P.H.).[139]
The Brown University School of Professional Studies currently
offers blended learning Executive master's degrees in Healthcare
Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and Technology
Leadership.[140] The master's degrees are designed to help
students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in
their respective fields. The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a weekly seminar each
trimester.
The university has also invested in MOOC development starting in 2013, when two courses,
Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets and The Fiction of Relationship, both of which received thousands of
students.[141] However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera and
revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released
new courses on edx, two of which were The Ethics of Memory and Artful Medicine: Art's Power to
Enrich Patient Care. In January 2018, Brown published its first "game-ified" course called Fantastic
Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature, which featured out-of-
platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into
a fictional world to help characters along their journey.[142]
Undergraduate admission to Brown University is
considered "most selective" by U.S. News & World
Report.[145] For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown
received 50,649 applications—the largest applicant pool

be extended to international first-year applicants starting with the Class of 2029.[150] In 2017, Brown
announced that loans would be eliminated from all undergraduate financial aid awards starting in
2018–2019, as part of a new $30 million campaign called the Brown Promise.[151] In 2016–17, the
university awarded need-based scholarships worth $120.5 million. The average need-based award for
the class of 2020 was $47,940.[152]
In 2017, the Graduate School accepted 11% of 9,215 applicants.[153] In 2021, Brown received a record

Washington Monthly ranked Brown 30th in 2024 among 438 national
universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as
measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[170]
In 2022, U.S. News & World Report ranks Brown 129th globally.
In 2014, Forbes magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of "America's Most
Entrepreneurial Universities."[171] The Forbes analysis looked at the ratio of
"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders and
business owners on LinkedIn" and the total number of alumni and students.
LinkedIn particularized the Forbes rankings, placing Brown third (between
MIT and Princeton) among "Best Undergraduate Universities for Software
Developers at Startups." LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-path
examination of "millions of alumni profiles" in its membership database.[172]
In 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbright
recipients of any university in the nation.[173][174][175] Brown has also
produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in the
United States.[176]
In 2025 the university ranked 229 of 257 top colleges in free speech rankings
by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and "College Pulse,"
after ranking at 69 in 2024 and at 114 in 2022/2023.[177][178][179]
Brown is a member of the Association of American Universities since 1933
and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research
Activity".[180][181] In FY 2017, Brown spent $212.3 million on research and was ranked 103rd in the
United States by total R&D expenditure by National Science Foundation.[182][183] In 2021 Brown's
School of Public Health received the 4th most funding in NIH awards among schools of public health
in the U.S.[184]
In 2014, Brown tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in the
nation, with its "total of reports of rape" on their main campus standing at 43.[186] However, such
rankings have been criticized for failing to account for how different campus environments can
encourage or discourage individuals from reporting sexual assault cases, thereby affecting the number
of reported rapes.[187]

Established in 1950, Spring Weekend is an
annual spring music festival for students.
Historical performers at the festival have
included Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie,
Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin,
Bruce Springsteen, and U2. More recent
headliners include Kendrick Lamar, Young
Thug, Daniel Caesar, Anderson .Paak,
Mitski, Aminé, and Mac

Spring Weekend has been organized by the
student-run Brown Concert Agency.
Approximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in Greek
Life.[193] The university recognizes thirteen active Greek
organizations. Since the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on
campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.[194]
The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate.
The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon
Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[12] The
organization seems to have disappeared during the American
Revolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian
Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the
Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the
Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824).
Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many
supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.[195][196]
Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger
societies generally leaned Republican.[12]
Societies remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were
largely replaced by fraternities.[196]
The Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-
perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the
club served as the de facto undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971
and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.

In 2023, 38% of Brown's students identified as being LGBTQ+, in a poll by The Brown Daily
Herald.[197] The 2023 LGBTQ+ self-identification level was an increase, up from 14% LGBT
identification in 2010.[197] "Bisexual" was the most common answer amongst LGBTQ+ respondents to
the poll.[197]
Brown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often
act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to
explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers
often provide physical spaces for students to study and have
meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some
provide academic support as well.
The Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC) is a space that
provides support for students of color. Established in 1972 at the
demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to
engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote
social justice.[198] The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and
engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer
Student organizations

Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC
hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and
study.
The Sarah Doyle Women's Center aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to
examine and explore issues surrounding gender.[199] The center was named after one of the first
women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle. The center emphasizes intersectionality in its conversations on
gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center
hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students,
faculty, and staff.[200]
Other centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-
Income Student (U-FLi) Center,[201] and the Curricular Resource Center.
On December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest of
an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a "stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading
place for Black students" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65
Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black student
enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US.
This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands
have yet to be met.[202][203]
In the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain companies involved in
South Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with partial divestment and began a fast in Manning
Chapel and the university disenrolled them. In April 1987, "dozens" of students interrupted a
university corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.[204]
In 2013, students and Providence community members protested and disrupted a speech by then-
NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The incident was cited by Greg Lukianoff, president of the
Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, as a high-profile example of a form of student
protest questioning conceptions of free speech.[205] The incident was also the subject of a short critical
documentary in 2016 by Brown alumnus Rob Montz.[206]
In early November 2023, twenty students of Jewish background staged a sit in at University hall,
resulting in their arrests. The students were protesting the Israel-Hamas war and calling for a
ceasefire, as well as for the university to divest from companies that "facilitate the 'Israeli military
occupation' in Gaza." In early December 2023, forty-one more students held a sit-in with similar

Brown is a member of the Ivy League athletic conference, which is
categorized as a Division I (top-level) conference of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
The Brown Bears has one of the largest university sports programs
in the United States, sponsoring 32 varsity intercollegiate
teams.[212] Brown's athletic program is one of the U.S. News &

breadth of the program and athletes' graduation rates.
Brown's newest varsity team is women's rugby,
promoted from club-sport status in 2014. Brown
women's rowing has won 7 national titles between 1999
and 2011.[213] Brown men's rowing perennially finishes
