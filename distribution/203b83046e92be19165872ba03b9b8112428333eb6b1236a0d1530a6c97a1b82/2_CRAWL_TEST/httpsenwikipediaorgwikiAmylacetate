It is colorless and has a scent similar to bananas and apples. The compound is the condensation product of acetic acid and 1-pentanol.  However, esters formed from other pentanol isomers (amyl alcohols), or mixtures of pentanols, are often referred to as amyl acetate. The symptoms of exposure to amyl acetate in humans are dermatitis, central nervous system depression, narcosis and irritation to the eyes and nose.\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nAmyl acetate is a solvent for paints, lacquers, and liquid bandages; and a flavorant.
