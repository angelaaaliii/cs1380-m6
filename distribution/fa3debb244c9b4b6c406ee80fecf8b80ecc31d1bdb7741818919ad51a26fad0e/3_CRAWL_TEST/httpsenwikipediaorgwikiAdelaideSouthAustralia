The city and parklands [/wiki/Adelaide_park_lands]\\narea also known as Tarntanya,[21] Tandanya (now the short name of Tandanya\\nNational Aboriginal Cultural Institute\\n[/wiki/Tandanya_National_Aboriginal_Cultural_Institute]), Tarndanya,[22] or\\nTarndanyangga (now the dual name for Victoria Square\\n[/wiki/Victoria_Square,_Adelaide] in the Kaurna language\\n[/wiki/Kaurna_language]).[23] The name means 'male red kangaroo rock', referring\\nto a rock formation on the site that has now been destroyed.[24]\\n\\nThe surrounding area was an open, grassy plain with patches of trees and shrubs,\\nwhich had been managed by hundreds of generations. Kaurna country encompassed\\nthe plains stretching north and south of Tarntanya, as well as the wooded\\nfoothills of the Mt Lofty Ranges [/wiki/Mount_Lofty_Ranges]. The River Torrens\\nwas known as the Karrawirra Pari (Red Gum forest river). About 300 Kaurna\\npopulated the Adelaide area, and were referred to by the settlers as the\\nCowandilla.[25]\\n\\nThe more than 20 local clans across the plain lived seminomadic lives, with\\nextensive mound settlements [/wiki/Mound] where huts were built repeatedly over\\ncenturies and a complex social structure, including a class of sorcerers\\nseparated from regular society.[26]\\n\\nWithin a few decades of European settlement of South Australia\\n[/wiki/European_settlement_of_South_Australia], Kaurna culture was almost\\ncompletely lost. The last speaker of Kaurna language [/wiki/Kaurna_language]\\ndied in 1929.[27] Extensive documentation by early missionaries and other\\nresearchers has enabled a modern revival of both,[28] which has included a\\ncommitment by local and state governments to rename or include Kaurna names for\\nmany local places.[29][30]\\n\\n\\n19TH CENTURY\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=Adelaide&action=edit&section=3]]\\nPainting of person\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Beechey%2C_William_-_Adelaide_of_Saxe-Meiningen_-_NPG_1533.jpg/250px-Beechey%2C_William_-_Adelaide_of_Saxe-Meiningen_-_NPG_1533.jpg]/wiki/File:Beechey,_William_-_Adelaide_of_Saxe-Meiningen_-_NPG_1533.jpgQueen\\nAdelaide, after whom the city was namedRefer to caption\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Adelaide_supplement_to_the_Illustrated_Sydney_News.png/250px-Adelaide_supplement_to_the_Illustrated_Sydney_News.png]/wiki/File:Adelaide_supplement_to_the_Illustrated_Sydney_News.pngIn\\nJuly 1876, the Illustrated Sydney News published a special supplement that\\nincluded an early aerial view of the City of Adelaide: (South) Adelaide (the\\nCBD), River Torrens, and portion of North Adelaide from a point above Strangways\\nTerrace, North Adelaide [/wiki/North_Adelaide]\\n\\nBased on the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield [/wiki/Edward_Gibbon_Wakefield]\\nabout colonial reform, Robert Gouger [/wiki/Robert_Gouger] petitioned the\\nBritish government to create a new colony in Australia, resulting in the passage\\nof the South Australia Act 1834 [/wiki/South_Australia_Act_1834]. Physical\\nestablishment of the colony began with the arrival of the first British\\ncolonisers in February 1836. The first governor\\n[/wiki/Governor_of_South_Australia] proclaimed the commencement of colonial\\ngovernment in South Australia on 28 December 1836, near The Old Gum Tree\\n[/wiki/The_Old_Gum_Tree] in what is now the suburb of Glenelg North\\n[/wiki/Glenelg_North]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as\\nProclamation Day [/wiki/Proclamation_Day_(South_Australia)].[31] The site of the\\ncolony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light\\n[/wiki/William_Light], the first surveyor-general of South Australia, with his\\nown original, unique, topographically sensitive design. The city was named after\\nQueen Adelaide [/wiki/Queen_Adelaide].[32]\\n\\nAdelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil\\nliberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of Edward\\nGibbon Wakefield [/wiki/Edward_Gibbon_Wakefield]. Wakefield had read accounts of\\nAustralian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an\\nheiress,[33] and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of\\navailable labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals.[34]\\nWakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate\\nthat would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and\\njourneymen.[35] Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out\\nworking-class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to\\never afford their own land.[36] As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not\\nshare the convict settlement history [/wiki/Convictism_in_Australia] of other\\nAustralian cities like Sydney [/wiki/Sydney], Brisbane [/wiki/Brisbane] and\\nHobart [/wiki/Hobart].\\n\\nPainting of a town near a river with woodlands and hills in the background\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/North_Terrace%2C_1841.jpg/250px-North_Terrace%2C_1841.jpg]/wiki/File:North_Terrace,_1841.jpgNorth\\nTerrace [/wiki/North_Terrace,_Adelaide] in 1841\\n\\nAs it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little\\ncrime, no provision was made for a gaol [/wiki/Prison] in Colonel Light's 1837\\nplan. But by mid-1837 the South Australian Register\\n[/wiki/South_Australian_Register] was warning of escaped convicts from New South\\nWales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a\\nmurder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor\\nHindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now the South Australia\\nPolice [/wiki/South_Australia_Police]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old Henry\\nInman [/wiki/Henry_Inman_(police_commander)].[37] The first sheriff, Samuel\\nSmart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders,\\nMichael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia.[38]\\nWilliam Baker Ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in 1839, and\\nin 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new\\ngaol.[39] Construction of Adelaide Gaol [/wiki/Adelaide_Gaol] commenced in\\n1841.[40]\\n\\nAdelaide's early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable\\nleadership.[dubious [/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement] \\ndiscuss [/wiki/Talk:Adelaide#Dubious]] The first governor of South Australia,\\nJohn Hindmarsh [/wiki/John_Hindmarsh], clashed frequently with others, in\\nparticular the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher\\n[/wiki/James_Hurtle_Fisher].

His plan, sometimes\\nreferred to as \\\"Light's Vision\\\" (also the name of a statue of him on Montefiore\\nHill [/wiki/Montefiore_Hill]), arranged Adelaide in a grid [/wiki/Grid_plan],\\nwith five squares [/wiki/Category:Squares_in_Adelaide] in the Adelaide city\\ncentre [/wiki/Adelaide_city_centre] and a ring of parks, known as the Adelaide\\nParklands [/wiki/Adelaide_Parklands], surrounding it. Light's selection of the\\nlocation for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well\\nas South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from\\nthe harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.[78]\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Adelaide_South_Australia_-_panoramio.jpg/250px-Adelaide_South_Australia_-_panoramio.jpg]/wiki/File:Adelaide_South_Australia_-_panoramio.jpgThe\\ncity centre [/wiki/Adelaide_city_centre] was built on a grid plan\\n[/wiki/Grid_plan], known as Light's Vision.\\n\\nLight successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial\\nopposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George\\nKingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates\\nfor city plans going back to Ancient Greece [/wiki/Ancient_Greece], including\\nItalian Renaissance [/wiki/Italian_Renaissance] designs and the similar layouts\\nof the American cities Philadelphia [/wiki/Philadelphia] and Savannah\\n[/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia]which, like Adelaide, follow the same layout of a\\ncentral city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a\\nparklands area that surrounds the city centre.[79]\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Transformers_-_Victoria_Square_Adelaide_SA_-_panoramio.jpg/250px-Transformers_-_Victoria_Square_Adelaide_SA_-_panoramio.jpg]/wiki/File:Transformers_-_Victoria_Square_Adelaide_SA_-_panoramio.jpgAerial\\nview of Victoria Square [/wiki/Victoria_Square,_Adelaide], one of the five main\\nsquares in the city centre and considered the heart of Adelaide's grid layout\\n[/wiki/Grid_plan]\\n\\nThe benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane\\nroads from its beginning, an easily navigable cardinal direction\\n[/wiki/Cardinal_direction] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the\\ncity centre. There are two sets of ring roads [/wiki/Ring_road] in Adelaide that\\nhave resulted from the original design. The inner ring route\\n[/wiki/City_Ring_Route,_Adelaide] (A21 [/wiki/A21_road_(Australia)]) borders the\\nparklands, and the outer route (A3 [/wiki/A3_road_(South_Australia)]/A13\\n[/wiki/South_Road,_Adelaide]/A16 [/wiki/A16_highway_(Australia)]/A17\\n[/wiki/A17_highway_(Australia)]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in\\nclockwise order) Grand Junction Road [/wiki/Grand_Junction_Road], Hampstead\\nRoad, Ascot Avenue, Portrush Road [/wiki/Portrush_Road], Cross Road\\n[/wiki/Cross_Road,_Adelaide] and South Road [/wiki/South_Road,_Adelaide].[80]\\n\\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous\\nformer outlying villages and \\\"country towns\\\", as well as the satellite city of\\nElizabeth [/wiki/Elizabeth,_South_Australia], have been enveloped by its\\nsuburban sprawl [/wiki/Urban_sprawl]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide\\nHills region led to the construction of the South Eastern Freeway\\n[/wiki/South_Eastern_Freeway] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to\\nnew developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly,\\nthe booming development in Adelaide's South [/wiki/City_of_Onkaparinga] led to\\nthe construction of the Southern Expressway\\n[/wiki/Southern_Expressway_(Australia)].\\n\\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the\\nurban growth. The O-Bahn Busway [/wiki/O-Bahn_Busway] is an example of a unique\\nsolution to Tea Tree Gully's [/wiki/Tea_Tree_Gully,_South_Australia] transport\\nwoes in the 1980s.[81] The development of the nearby suburb of Golden Grove\\n[/wiki/Golden_Grove,_South_Australia] in the late 1980s followed a planned\\napproach to urban growth.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, a Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study\\n[/wiki/Metropolitan_Adelaide_Transport_Study] Plan was proposed to cater for the\\nfuture growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways,\\nexpressways [/wiki/Controlled-access_highway] and the upgrade of certain aspects\\nof the public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall\\n[/wiki/Steele_Hall_(Australian_politician)] approved many parts of the plan and\\nthe government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor\\n[/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party] government elected under Don Dunstan\\n[/wiki/Don_Dunstan] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain\\nvacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the Liberal party\\n[/wiki/Liberal_party_of_Australia] won government and premier David Tonkin\\n[/wiki/David_Tonkin] committed his government to selling off the land acquired\\nfor the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of\\nmost MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have\\nbeen used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while\\nmost has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\\n\\nIn 2008, the SA Government [/wiki/Government_of_South_Australia] announced plans\\nfor a network of transport-oriented developments\\n[/wiki/Transport-oriented_development] across the Adelaide metropolitan area and\\npurchased a 10 hectare industrial site [/wiki/Clipsal_site_development] at\\nBowden [/wiki/Bowden,_South_Australia] for $52.5million as the first of these\\ndevelopments.[82][83]\\n\\nHOUSING\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=Adelaide&action=edit&section=9]]\\nMain article: Australian residential architectural styles\\n[/wiki/Australian_residential_architectural_styles]\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Heritage_terraces_on_Adelaide%27s_North_Terrace.jpg/250px-Heritage_terraces_on_Adelaide%27s_North_Terrace.jpg]/wiki/File:Heritage_terraces_on_Adelaide%27s_North_Terrace.jpgTerraced\\nhousing on North Terrace [/wiki/North_Terrace,_Adelaide]\\n\\nHistorically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by\\nsingle-storey detached houses built on 1,000-square-metre (14-acre) blocks. A\\nrelative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes\\nled to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of\\nstone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891, 68% of houses were built of\\nstone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in\\nstone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and\\nfireplaces.[84]\\n\\nThere is a wide variety in the styles of these houses. Until the 1960s, most of\\nthe more substantial houses were built of red brick, though many front walls\\nwere of ornamental stone. Then cream bricks became fashionable, and in the\\n1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.[citation needed\\n[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with\\n(painted) corrugated iron [/wiki/Corrugated_iron] or cement or clay tiles,\\nusually red \\\"terracotta\\\". Since then, Colorbond [/wiki/Colorbond] corrugated\\nsteel has dominated. Most roofs are pitched. Flat roofs are not common.[85]\\n\\nUp to the 1970s, most houses were of \\\"double brick\\\" construction on concrete\\nfootings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by \\\"dwarf walls\\\". Later\\nhouses have mainly been of \\\"brick veneer [/wiki/Brick_veneer]\\\" construction \\nstructural timber [/wiki/Framing_(construction)] or, more recently, lightweight\\nsteel [/wiki/Steel_frame#Cold-formed_steel_frames] frame on a concrete slab\\n[/wiki/Concrete_slab] foundation [/wiki/Foundation_(engineering)], lined with\\nGyprock [/wiki/Gyprock], and with an outer skin of brickwork,[85] to cope with\\nAdelaide's reactive soils [/wiki/Shrink%E2%80%93swell_capacity], particularly\\nKeswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils.[86] The use of precast\\nconcrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased.[85] In\\naddition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the\\nrole of the South Australian Housing Trust\\n[/wiki/South_Australian_Housing_Trust].[why?
