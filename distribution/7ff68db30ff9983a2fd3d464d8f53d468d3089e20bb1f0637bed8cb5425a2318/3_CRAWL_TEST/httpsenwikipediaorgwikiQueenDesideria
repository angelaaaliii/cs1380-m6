Eugnie Dsire Clary (Swedish [/wiki/Swedish_language]: Eugenia\\nBernhardina Desideria;[1] 8 November 1777  17 December 1860) was Queen of\\nSweden [/wiki/List_of_Swedish_royal_consorts] and Norway\\n[/wiki/List_of_Norwegian_consorts] from 5 February 1818 to 8 March 1844 as the\\nwife of King Charles XIV John [/wiki/Charles_XIV_John]. Charles John was a\\nFrench general and founder of the House of Bernadotte\\n[/wiki/House_of_Bernadotte]. Dsire Clary, the mother of Oscar I\\n[/wiki/Oscar_I_of_Sweden], was the one-time fiance [/wiki/Fianc%C3%A9e] of\\nNapoleon Bonaparte [/wiki/Napoleon]. Her name was officially changed in Sweden\\nto Desideria although she did not use that name.[2]\\n\\n\\nBACKGROUND AND EDUCATION\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary&action=edit&section=1]]\\n\\nDsire Clary was born in Marseille [/wiki/Marseille], France\\n[/wiki/Kingdom_of_France], the daughter of Franois Clary\\n[/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Clary] (Marseille, St. Ferreol, 24 February 1725 \\nMarseille, 20 January 1794), a wealthy silk [/wiki/Silk] manufacturer and\\nmerchant, by his second wife (m. 26 June 1759) Franoise Rose Somis (Marseille,\\nSt. Ferreol, 30 August 1737  Paris, 28 January 1815). Eugnie was normally used\\nas her name of address.[3] Her father had been previously married, at Marseille\\non 13 April 1751, to Gabrielle Flchon (1732  3 May 1758).\\n\\nClary had a sister and brother to whom she remained very close all her life. Her\\nsister, Julie Clary [/wiki/Julie_Clary], married Joseph Bonaparte\\n[/wiki/Joseph_Bonaparte]; she later became Queen of Naples [/wiki/Naples] and\\nSpain [/wiki/Spain]. Her brother, Nicolas Joseph Clary, was created Count Clary.\\nHe married Anne Jeanne Rouyer, by whom he had a daughter named Znade Franoise\\nClary (Paris, 25 November 1812  Paris, 27 April 1884). Znade would marry\\nNapolon Alexandre Berthier\\n[/wiki/Napol%C3%A9on_Alexandre_Berthier,_2nd_Prince_of_Wagram] (the son of\\nMarshal Louis Alexandre Berthier [/wiki/Louis_Alexandre_Berthier]) and have\\nseveral children, among them the first wife of Joachim, 4th Prince Murat\\n[/wiki/Joachim,_4th_Prince_Murat].\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary1807-Robert_Lef%C3%A8vre.jpg/250px-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary1807-Robert_Lef%C3%A8vre.jpg]/wiki/File:D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary1807-Robert_Lef%C3%A8vre.jpgAn\\nearly portrait by Robert Lefvre [/wiki/Robert_Lef%C3%A8vre]\\n\\nAs a child, Clary received the convent [/wiki/Convent] schooling usually given\\nto daughters of the upper classes in pre-revolutionary France. However, when she\\nwas barely 11 years old, the French Revolution [/wiki/French_Revolution]\\n(starting in 1789) took place, during which convents were closed.[4] Clary\\nreturned to live with her parents, where she was perforce home-schooled\\nthereafter. Later, her education was described as shallow.[5] It has been\\nobserved by several historians that Clary was devoted to her birth-family her\\nentire life.\\n\\n\\nMEETING THE BONAPARTES\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary&action=edit&section=2]]\\n\\nIn 1794, Clary's father died. Shortly after, it was discovered that in the years\\nbefore the revolution, he had made an appeal to be ennobled, a request that had\\nbeen denied. Because of this, Dsire Clary's brother Etienne, now the head of\\nthe family and her guardian, was arrested. Dsire Clary went to talk on his\\nbehalf and seek his release from the holding. In the process, she met Joseph\\nBonaparte [/wiki/Joseph_Bonaparte], inviting him back to their home. Joseph was\\nsoon engaged to her elder sister Julie [/wiki/Julie_Clary], while Napoleon was\\nengaged to Dsire Clary on 21 April 1795. In 17951797, Clary lived with her\\nmother in Genoa [/wiki/Genoa] in Italy, where her brother-in-law Joseph had a\\ndiplomatic mission; they were also joined by the Bonaparte family\\n[/wiki/Bonaparte_family]. In 1795, Napoleon became involved with Josphine de\\nBeauharnais [/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais] and broke the engagement to\\nClary on 6 September. He married Josphine in 1796.\\n\\nIn 1797, Clary went to live in Rome [/wiki/Rome] with her sister Julie and her\\nbrother-in-law Joseph, who was French ambassador to the Papal States\\n[/wiki/Papal_States]. Her relationship with Julie remained close. She was\\nbriefly engaged to Mathurin-Lonard Duphot [/wiki/Mathurin-L%C3%A9onard_Duphot],\\na French general. The engagement has been assumed to be Napoleon's idea to\\ncompensate her with a marriage, while Duphot was attracted to her dowry and\\nposition as sister-in-law of Napoleon. She agreed to the engagement though\\nDuphot had a long-term relationship and a son with another woman. On 30 December\\n1797, on the eve of their marriage, Duphot was killed in an anti-French riot\\noutside of their residence Palazzo Corsini [/wiki/Palazzo_Corsini,_Rome] in\\nRome.[5] In later years, Clary vehemently denied that her engagement to Duphot\\nhad ever existed.[3]\\n\\n\\nMADAME BERNADOTTE\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary&action=edit&section=3]]\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Desiree_Clary.jpg/200px-Desiree_Clary.jpg]/wiki/File:Desiree_Clary.jpgDsire\\nClary by Franois Grard [/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_G%C3%A9rard] (1810)\\n\\nAfter her return to France, Clary lived with Julie and Joseph in Paris. In\\nParis, she lived in the circle of the Bonaparte family, who sided with her\\nagainst Josephine after Napoleon had broken off their engagement. She herself\\ndid not like Josephine either, as she has been quoted calling her an aged\\ncourtesan with a deservedly bad reputation, but she is not believed to have\\nshown any hostility toward Josephine as did the members of the Bonaparte family.\\nShe received a proposal from General Junot [/wiki/Jean-Andoche_Junot], but\\nturned it down because it was given through Marmont\\n[/wiki/Auguste_de_Marmont].[6] Clary eventually met her future spouse, Jean\\nBaptiste Jules Bernadotte [/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden], another French\\ngeneral and politician. They were married in a secular ceremony at Sceaux\\n[/wiki/Sceaux,_Hauts-de-Seine] on 17 August 1798.[6] In the marriage contract,\\nClary was given economic independence.[5] On 4 July 1799, she gave birth to\\ntheir only child, a son, Oscar [/wiki/Oscar_I_of_Sweden].\\n\\nDuring the coup of 1799 [/wiki/Coup_of_18_Brumaire], when Napoleon took power,\\nshe was exposed to manipulation from both the Bonaparte family, who wanted\\nBernadotte to support Napoleon, and the Bernadotte faction, who wanted him to\\ntake action for himself. Both sides tried to use her to influence Bernadotte and\\nextract information from him about his attitudes. Aware of this, he did not tell\\nher of his plans, but he was later to say that it was because of family\\ninfluence that he had been passive during the coup. During the coup, the couple\\nwere forced to take refuge in the country villa of General Sarrazin at\\nVilleneuve St. Georges: she apparently dressed as a man during the escape. She\\nkept in contact with Julie all the time, and Napoleon accepted Bernadotte\\napparently because of her.\\n\\nIn 1800, Dsire Bernadotte was present at a failed assassination attempt on\\nNapoleon, when a bomb exploded between the carriage of Napoleon and the carriage\\nwhere she and Caroline Bonaparte were sitting. She was not interested in\\npolitics, but her good connections made her a puppet in the hands of her husband\\nand Napoleon, who both used her to influence each other and to pass messages.[5]\\nIn 1801, her husband had her interfere in favor of General Ernouf\\n[/wiki/Jean_Augustin_Ernouf] through Joseph.[6] In 1802, a conspiracy against\\nNapoleon was discovered. Napoleon suspected Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, and\\ninterrogated his wife, who naively told him that her spouse had not been\\ninvolved, though he had met Moreau [/wiki/Jean_Victor_Marie_Moreau] in their\\nhome and mumbled his name as well as the word conspiracy in his sleep.[6] After\\nthis, Napoleon appointed her husband governor of Louisiana\\n[/wiki/Louisiana_(New_France)]. The couple was ready to sail, when the\\nappointment was retracted.\\n\\nOn 19 May 1804, her spouse was made Marshal of France, which gave her the\\nequivalent position. However, she was described as indifferent to social\\nposition, like her sister Julie. Napoleon gave her an allowance, and a house in\\nRue d'Anjou Saint-Honor, where she resided for the rest of her life when in\\nParis. At the Coronation of Napoleon [/wiki/Coronation_of_Napoleon] on 2\\nDecember 1804, she followed Josephine, whose train was carried by her\\nsisters-in-law, carrying the handkerchief and veil of Josephine on a pillow.[6]\\n\\nHer spouse was a leading general in the French army under Napoleon, and normally\\nabsent from Paris. He liked her to be a member of high society, and had her take\\nlessons in dance and etiquette from an instructor Montel. Bernadotte had a good\\nrelationship with the Bonaparte Imperial family. Upon the request of her spouse,\\nshe did not have to be a lady-in-waiting, and did not participate in court life.\\nShe lived in the circle of the Bonaparte and Clary family and also participated\\nin high society, where she enjoyed music, theater and dance, while she spent her\\nsummers at spas or her country villas at La Grange and Auteuil\\n[/wiki/Auteuil_(disambiguation)].

She had been met in Helsingborg by her appointed\\nMistress of the Robes Countess Caroline Lewenhaupt [/wiki/Caroline_Lewenhaupt]\\nand the maid of honor Mariana Koskull [/wiki/Mariana_Koskull]. The Swedish\\nclimate was reportedly a shock for her: she arrived during the winter, and she\\nhated the snow so much that she cried.[5] Her spouse had converted upon his\\nelection as heir to the Swedish throne, and upon their arrival, her son was also\\nto do so, as was required, and was taken from her to be brought up a Lutheran\\n[/wiki/Lutheran]. There was, in accordance with the Tolerance Act\\n[/wiki/Tolerance_Act_(Sweden)], no demand that she should convert, and a\\nCatholic chapel was arranged for her use.[6] Desideria was not religious,[6] but\\nthe Catholic masses served to remind her of France, and she celebrated the birth\\nof Napoleon II [/wiki/Napoleon_II] by a Te Deum [/wiki/Te_Deum] in her chapel.\\n\\nDesideria was unable to adapt to the demands of formal court etiquette or\\nparticipate in the representational duties which were required of her in her\\nposition of Crown Princess. Her French entourage, especially Elise la Flotte\\n[/wiki/Elise_la_Flotte], made her unpopular during her stay in Sweden by\\nencouraging her to complain about everything.[2] She did not have a good\\nrelationship with Queen Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte\\n[/wiki/Hedwig_Elizabeth_Charlotte_of_Holstein-Gottorp], though the Dowager Queen\\nSophia Magdalena [/wiki/Sophia_Magdalena_of_Denmark] was reportedly kind to her.\\nIn her famous diaries, Queen Charlotte described her as good hearted, generous\\nand pleasant when she chose to be and not one to plot, but also an immature\\n\\\"spoiled child\\\", who hated all demands and was unable to handle any form of\\nrepresentation, and as \\\"a French woman in every inch\\\" who disliked and\\ncomplained about everything which was not French, and \\\"consequently, she is not\\nliked.\\\"[7]Queen Charlotte, who wanted to remain the center of attention at her\\nown court, was not pleased with Desideria and also influenced King Charles\\nagainst her.[3]\\n\\nDesideria left Sweden in the summer of 1811 under the name of Countess of\\nGotland [/wiki/Gotland], officially because of her health, and returned to\\nParis, leaving her husband and her son behind. She herself said that the Swedish\\nnobility had treated her as if they were made of ice: \\\"Do not talk with me of\\nStockholm, I get a cold as soon as I hear the word.\\\"[8] In Sweden, her husband\\ntook a mistress, the noblewoman Mariana Koskull [/wiki/Mariana_Koskull].\\n\\nUnder the same alias, Desideria officially resided incognito in Paris, thereby\\navoiding politics. However, her house at rue d'Anjou was watched by the secret\\npolice, and her letters were read by them. She had no court, just her lady's\\ncompanion Elise la Flotte to assist her as hostess at her receptions, and she\\nmostly associated with a circle of close friends and family. Her receptions were\\nfrequented by Talleyrand [/wiki/Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord] and\\nFouch [/wiki/Joseph_Fouch%C3%A9], who upon the mission of Napoleon tried to\\ninfluence her consort through her.[6] In 1812, she acted as mediator when\\nNapoleon negotiated with her consort through the Duke de Bassano\\n[/wiki/Hugues-Bernard_Maret,_duc_de_Bassano]. Her consort liked her to be placed\\nin Paris, where she could calm Napoleon's rage over the politics of Sweden and\\nkeep him informed about the events in the center of European politics, but as\\ntheir correspondence has been lost, it is not known how political it was.[6]\\nDuring the meeting between her husband and Tsar Alexander I of Russia\\n[/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia] in bo [/wiki/%C3%85bo] in 1812, the Tsar\\nsuggested that Charles John divorce her and marry one of his sisters, but the\\nKing turned down the proposal.[6]\\n\\nBefore his attack on Russia, Napoleon asked Desideria to leave France. She made\\nherself ready to leave, but managed to avoid it. As she officially lived\\nincognito, she could avoid politics when Sweden and France declared war in 1813.\\nDuring the summer of 1813, she retired to the country estate of Julie,\\nMortefontaine, with Catharina of Wrttemberg\\n[/wiki/Catharina_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg] to avoid attention before she returned to\\nParis New Year's Eve of 1814. The 31 March 1814, upon the arrival of the allied\\narmies in Paris after the defeat of Napoleon, her house was a refuge for her\\nsister Julie. She met up with her spouse, who was among the allied generals to\\narrive in Paris. She did not return with him to Sweden when he left, however,\\nwhich attracted attention. When asked why by the Swedish Count Jacob De la\\nGardie at Mortefontaine, she answered that she was afraid that she would be\\ndivorced if she did.[6]\\n\\nOn 14 May 1814, she was introduced to Louis XVIII of France\\n[/wiki/Louis_XVIII_of_France], whose court she often visited the following years\\nand whom she is said to have liked quite well. After the Hundred Days\\n[/wiki/Hundred_Days] in 1815, the members of the Bonaparte family were exiled\\nfrom France. This included her sister Julie, and when Louis XVIII expressed a\\nwish to do her a favor, she regularly asked him to make an exception for Julie\\nand allow her to live in Paris. In 1816, she made plans to return to Sweden, but\\nshe wished to bring her sister, Julie, along with her. Her husband thought this\\nunwise. Julie was the wife of a Bonaparte and her presence might be taken as a\\nsign that he sided with the deposed Napoleon. In the end, this came to\\nnothing.[9] At this point, she often spent time with Germaine de Stal\\n[/wiki/Germaine_de_Sta%C3%ABl] and Juliette Rcamier\\n[/wiki/Juliette_R%C3%A9camier].

However, she remained in France, officially for health reasons,\\nwhich caused speculations in the press in Paris and by her visitors. After she\\nbecame queen, the queen dowager wrote to her and suggested that she should have\\nSwedish ladies-in-waiting, but she replied that it was unnecessary for her to\\nhave a court since she still resided incognito. She officially kept herself\\nincognito and did not host any court, but she kept in contact with the Swedish\\nembassy, regularly visited the court of Louis XVIII, and often saw Swedes at her\\nreceptions, which she hosted on Thursdays and Sundays, unofficially in her role\\nas queen, though she still used the title of countess.\\n\\nDuring this period, she fell in love with the French prime minister, the Duc de\\nRichelieu [/wiki/Armand-Emmanuel_du_Plessis,_Duc_de_Richelieu], which attracted\\nattention.[6] According to one version, she fell in love with him after Louis\\nXVIII had assigned him to deny her regular appeal for her sister Julie in the\\nmost charming way possible. True or not, she did fall in love with him, but the\\naffection was not returned by Richelieu, who referred to her as his \\\"crazy\\nQueen\\\".[6] According to Laure Junot [/wiki/Laure_Junot], she did not dare to\\nspeak to him or approach him, but she followed him wherever he went, tried to\\nmake contact with him, followed him on his trip to Spa, and had flowers placed\\nin his room.[6] She followed him around until his death in 1822.[5] Another\\nversion of her behavior toward him was, that her consort had given her the task\\nto make contact with Richelieu for political reasons, but that his attitude had\\nmade her too embarrassed to do so.[6]\\n\\nDuring the summer of 1822, her son Oscar made a trip in Europe to inspect\\nprospective brides, and it was decided they should meet. As France was deemed\\nunsuitable, they met in Aachen [/wiki/Aachen] and a second time in Switzerland.\\nIn 1823, Desideria returned to Sweden together with her son's bride, Josephine\\nof Leuchtenberg [/wiki/Josephine_of_Leuchtenberg]. It was intended to be a\\nvisit, but she was to remain in Sweden for the rest of her life. She and\\nJosephine arrived in Stockholm 13 June 1823. Three days later, the royal court\\nand the government were presented to her, and on 19 June, she participated in\\nthe official welcoming of Josephine and witnessed the wedding. A well-known\\nstory is that after her return to Sweden there was a warm and dry period, so the\\npeasants turning up to see her were coaxed into greeting her with \\\"Vi vill ha\\nregn!\\\" (\\\"We want rain!\\\"), which in the Scanian dialect [/wiki/Scanian_dialect]\\nsounds very similar to the French \\\"Vive la Reine!\\\" (\\\"Long live the Queen!\\\").[10]\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Desideria_of_Sweden_coronation_1829_by_Fredric_Westin.jpg/250px-Desideria_of_Sweden_coronation_1829_by_Fredric_Westin.jpg]/wiki/File:Desideria_of_Sweden_coronation_1829_by_Fredric_Westin.jpgDesideria's\\nSwedish coronation in 1829, by Fredric Westin.\\n\\nOn 21 August 1829, she was crowned Queen of Sweden in Storkyrkan\\n[/wiki/Storkyrkan] in Stockholm. Her coronation had been suggested upon her\\nreturn, but her husband had postponed it because he feared there could be\\nreligious difficulties. There was actually a suggestion that she should convert\\nto the Lutheran faith before her coronation, but in the end, the question was\\nnot considered important enough to press, and she was crowned all the same. She\\nwas crowned at her own request after having pressed Charles John with a wish\\nthat she should be crowned as \\\"otherwise she would be no proper Queen\\\".[11] A\\nreason for her insistence is believed to have been that she regarded it as\\nprotection against divorce.[12] She was, however, never crowned in Norway\\nbecause of her status as a Catholic, despite requesting to be crowned there as\\nwell. She was the first commoner to become a queen of Sweden since Karin\\nMnsdotter [/wiki/Karin_M%C3%A5nsdotter] in 1568.\\n\\nThe relationship between her and her husband King Charles XIV John was somewhat\\ndistant, but friendly. Charles John treated her with some irritability, while\\nshe behaved very freely and informally toward him. The court was astonished by\\nher informal behavior. She could enter his bedroom and stay there until late at\\nnight even though he hinted to her that he wished to be alone with his favorite\\nCount Magnus Brahe [/wiki/Magnus_Brahe_(1790%E2%80%931844)].[6] Every morning,\\nshe visited her husband in her nightgown, which was seen as shocking, because\\nher husband usually conferred with members of the council of state in his\\nbedchamber at that time. Because of their difference in habits, they seldom saw\\neach other even though they lived together. Because she was always late at\\ndinner, for example, he stopped having his meals with her, and as he also\\npreferred to have his meals alone, it was not uncommon for the nobles of the\\ncourt to sit alone at the dinner table, without the royal couple present.[5]\\n\\nThere is nothing to indicate that Queen Desideria ever had any political\\ninfluence, and she was praised for her lack of interference in politics.\\nWhenever Charles John became agitated, she was known to be able to calm him with\\nthe one firm word \\\"Bernadotte!\\\"[6] One such anecdote was when Charles John,\\nknown for his hot temperament, raged about how he would punish some political\\nadvisories in various ways. For every punishment he stated, she is said to have\\nstruck her fan in the table and said to the surrounding courtiers \\\"He could not\\nhurt a cat!\\\", upon which the court started to laugh.[6] She was also to have\\nsaid \\\"Oh, I like to hear you say that, you who do not even have the heart to\\nwring the neck of a cat!\\\"[6]\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_c_1830.jpg/250px-Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_c_1830.jpg]/wiki/File:Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_c_1830.jpgQueen\\nDesideria about 1830\\n\\nQueen Desideria enjoyed social life, but only if it was informal, and her strong\\ndislike of court etiquette, and refusal to submit to it, made it hard for her to\\naccustom to her position as queen and make herself respected by the nobility,\\nwho privately ridiculed her difficulty to adjust to etiquette,[13] and she was\\nalso regarded with some snobbery because of her past as a merchant's daughter\\nand a republican.\\n\\nConsequently, it was difficult for her to discipline her aristocratic\\nladies-in-waiting, whom Charles John appointed without consulting her, and who\\npreferred to sort out conflicts regarding etiquette among themselves instead of\\nasking her to mediate, which on at least one occasion led to a scene which\\ncaused Charles John to reprimand her: \\\"Try to make your ladies not to announce\\ntheir actions and conflicts to the public as it happened the day you departed\\nfrom Stockholm\\\", after an incident when two ladies-in-waiting had \\\"screamed like\\nrower madams [/wiki/Rower_woman]\\\" about precedence in the seats of the queen's\\ncarriage during a journey.[13] These difficulties were somewhat subdued during\\nthe tenure of her niece Marcelle Tascher de la Pagerie\\n[/wiki/Marcelle_Tascher_de_la_Pagerie], who made a social success, and her first\\nyears as queen are described as a time of balls and parties, more than had been\\nseen at the Swedish court since the days of King Gustav III\\n[/wiki/Gustav_III_of_Sweden]. After the departure of Tascher to France, however,\\nDsire's difficulties with court life became more marked. She gradually reduced\\nher participation in social life because she could find not pleasure in it when\\nit must be conducted in accordance with etiquette.[13] Her dislike of formal\\ncourt etiquette remained her foremost complaint about her life in Sweden in her\\nletters to her sister Julie:\\n\\n\\\"How boring courts can be, when you are not born within them. [...] The ladies\\nwho attend me are not very funny and I am forced to restrict myself physically\\nand morally [...] I can never adjust myself to the strict etiquette, which must\\nalways be observed at court [...] When you live surrounded by a court and are\\nforced to express your feelings in the form of polite phrases, which are\\ndemanded at court, the difficulties are so great that you would rather not.\\\"[13]\\n\\nConsequently, with time she participated less and less in court life, and it was\\nsaid that she \\\"spent her most time in her own apartment, where her thoughts with\\nregret trailed back to the time when she, surrounded by affectionate friends,\\nlived in France free from the prison of etiquette.\\\"[13] By the early 1830s, she\\nhad grown tired of her royal status and wished to return to Paris, but her\\nhusband refused to allow it. This is not to say that Dsire did not befriend\\nsome of her courtiers, particularly Countess Clara Bonde [/wiki/Clara_Bonde],\\nwho was her favorite from her arrival in 1823 to her death. After the departure\\nof her niece to France, she often socialized with the rich merchant Carl Abraham\\nArfwedson [/wiki/Carl_Abraham_Arfwedson], who had once been a guest in her\\nchildhood home.[6] Among her other more known ladies-in-waiting were the\\nNorwegians Kathinka Falbe and Jana Falbe. Because of Desideria's eccentric\\nhabits, they were known as \\\"Strapatsfrknarna\\\" (approximately \\\"Mesdemoiselles\\nCalamity\\\").[5] During her stays at Rosersberg Palace and in spite of her fear of\\nthe dark, she took walks in the park at night, and instructed one\\nlady-in-waiting to walk in front of her dressed in white to keep bats\\n[/wiki/Bat] away from her.[2]\\n\\nDesideria was interested in fashion, devoted a lot of interest and pride in her\\nhair and wore low cut dresses until an advanced age. She enjoyed dancing: her\\nstandard question at court presentations was if the debutantes liked to dance,\\nand she herself danced well also during her old age. Her conversations were\\nmainly about her old life in France. She never learned to speak the Swedish\\nlanguage, and there are many anecdotes of her attempts to speak the language.\\nHer lack of etiquette became more accepted over the years, as she became known\\nas an eccentric in other aspects.\\n\\nLike her daughter-in-law, Desideria was a Catholic, but in contrast to\\nJosephine, who was a devout and practicing Catholic, she never was.[6] Her\\ndevout Catholic daughter-in-law insisted that she attend mass and confession.[5]\\nShe did attend masses to please Josephine, but stated that she had no sins to\\nconfess. When the priest started to preach and reprimand her, she silenced him\\nand stated that such talk irritated her nerves.[6]\\n\\nHer favorite summer residence was Rosersberg Palace [/wiki/Rosersberg_Palace],\\nwhere she kept chickens for pets, but as Rosersberg was remote, she more\\ncommonly stayed at Haga Palace. She also often visited Swedish spas, such as\\nRamlsa [/wiki/Raml%C3%B6sa_H%C3%A4lsobrunn].\\n\\nDesideria visited Norway for the first time in 1825.[5] In Norway, she is mostly\\nknown as the patroness of Maria Schandorff [/wiki/Maria_Schandorff]'s Eugenia\\nstiftelse (Eugenia Foundation) for poor girls in Oslo, named for the queen,\\nwhich she often visited from 1828 until 1847.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN MOTHER\\n\\n[edit [/w/index.php?title=D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary&action=edit&section=6]]\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Desideria_caricature_by_Fritz_von_Dardel.png/220px-Desideria_caricature_by_Fritz_von_Dardel.png]/wiki/File:Desideria_caricature_by_Fritz_von_Dardel.pngAn\\n1850s caricature of Dowager Queen Desideria by Fritz von Dardel\\n[/wiki/Fritz_von_Dardel]\\n\\nIn 1844, Charles XIV John died and Desideria became the queen mother. Her son,\\nthe new King Oscar I, allowed her to keep living in the queen's quarters in the\\nRoyal Palace as well as her entire court staff out of consideration, so that she\\nwould not have to change her habits. When her daughter-in-law Queen Josephine\\ntried to convince her to reduce her court of her own free will, saying that she\\nno longer needed such a big court as a queen mother, she answered \\\"It is true\\nthat I no longer need them all, but all of them still need me.\\\"[6] She was a\\nconsiderate and well-liked employer among her staff.\\n\\nDesideria did engage in charity but it was discreet, and it has been said: \\\"Her\\ncharity was considerable but took place in silence\\\". One example was that she\\nsupported poor upper-class women by giving them sewing work. She also acted as\\nofficial protector of charitable institutions, such as the Women's Society Girl\\nSchool [/wiki/Fruntimmersf%C3%B6reningens_flickskola]. The same year she became\\na widow, she was described by the French diplomat Bacourt: \\\"Royalty has not\\naltered her  unfortunately, for the reputation of the Crown. She has always\\nbeen and will always remain an ordinary merchant woman, surprised over her\\nposition, and surprising to find upon a throne.\\\"[6] He also added that she was a\\ngoodhearted woman.\\n\\nAfter her return to Sweden in 1823, Desideria had kept her house at Rue d'Anjou\\nin Paris awaiting her return. It was managed by her sister Catherine Honorine\\nVilleneuve and her old French staff, while her business in France was managed by\\nher nephew, Imperial Count Clary. In May 1853, after Napoleon III\\n[/wiki/Napoleon_III] had made himself French emperor, she made preparations to\\nreturn to Paris. Everything was ready, and she was escorted to her ship in\\nKarlskrona [/wiki/Karlskrona] by her grandson Prince Oscar, Duke of stergtland\\n[/wiki/Oscar_II_of_Sweden]. Her fear of sea travels, however, made it impossible\\nfor her to leave.[6]\\n\\nDuring her last years, she was worried about her house in Paris because of the\\nplans of the city architect Haussmann [/wiki/Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne_Haussmann], but\\nNapoleon III made an exception for her and allowed for her house to stand, which\\nit did until one year after her death.[6] Desideria had a fairly harmonious\\nrelationship with her daughter-in-law, and felt sympathy for her grandson's\\nbride, Princess Louise of the Netherlands [/wiki/Louise_of_the_Netherlands].\\n\\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_dead_1860.jpg/250px-Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_dead_1860.jpg]/wiki/File:Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_dead_1860.jpgPhotograph\\nat her\\ndeathbed[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_grave_2007.jpg/250px-Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_grave_2007.jpg]/wiki/File:Desideria_of_Sweden_%26_Norway_grave_2007.jpgDesideria's\\nsarcophagus in Riddarholm Church [/wiki/Riddarholmskyrkan]\\n\\nDuring her later years as queen, and particularly as a queen mother, she became\\nknown for her eccentricity. She is known to have kept reversed hours and,\\nconsequently, for often being late and keeping guests waiting, something which\\nagitated her spouse. Normally, she retired at four in the morning, and awoke at\\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon. Before she went to bed, she took a \\\"walk by\\ncarriage\\\". During these trips, she often paid unannounced visits, which were\\nnormally inconvenient because of the time. When the weather was bad, her\\ncarriage drove round the courtyard of the royal palace instead. It was normal\\nfor her to arrive for a visit to an opera when the show had ended. She went to\\nbed in the morning, got up in the evening, ate breakfast at night and wandered\\naround the corridors of the sleeping palace with a light.[5] An anecdote\\nillustrates this: in 1843, a palace guard saw the Queen fully dressed on a\\npalace balcony in the middle of the night. When he came home to his wife, he\\ntold her that she was lazy in comparison to the Queen, who had gotten up hours\\nbefore sunrise.[2] He thought the Queen Mother was up earlier than anyone else\\nin town, but in fact, she had not yet gone to bed.\\n\\nDesideria sometimes would take in children from the streets to the palace and\\ngive them sweets; she was not able to engage in any real conversation, but she\\nwould say \\\"Kom, kom!\\\" (Swedish for \\\"Come come!\\\")[5]\\n\\nThere are stories about people having been awakened by her carriage when she\\ndrove through the streets at night. The carriage sometimes stopped; she would\\nsleep for a while, and then she would wake and the carriage would continue on\\nits way.
