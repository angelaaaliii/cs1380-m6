{"type":"object","value":{"original_url":"{\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1leygjatal\"}","page_text":"{\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"Háleygjatal is a skaldic poem by Eyvindr Skáldaspillir written towards the end of the 10th century to establish the Hlaðir dynasty as the social equals of the Hárfagri dynasty\\nThe poem is only partially preserved in disjoint parts quoted in Skáldskaparmál, Heimskringla and two other manuscripts of kings' sagas. It appears to be a lesser imitation of Ynglingatal. Just like Ynglingatal it contains 27 generations (3 x 3 x 3), and some expressions appear to be borrowed from Ynglingatal. Moreover, it is composed in the same meter, kviðuháttr, and the theme seems to be to trace the lineage of the poet's patron to the gods.\\nA part of the poem quoted in Ynglinga saga mentions Odin and Skaði.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nHáleygjatal in Old Norse from heimskringla.no\\nLindow, John (2001).
