This includes agricultural inspection stations at the state's borders. The California State Board of Food and Agriculture is an advisory board to the governor and secretary.\\nAs of January 2019, the Secretary of Agriculture was Karen Ross, who is a member of Governor Gavin Newsom's cabinet, having originally been appointed to that post by Governor Jerry Brown in January, 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Divisions ==\\nThe Department of Food and Agriculture is internally divided into seven administration divisions, carrying out state food safety and regulation policy:\\nThe Animal Health and Food Safety Services (AHFSS) provides services to protect California's poultry and livestock, to ensure safety of food from animal origin, to protect public health, and to protect livestock owners against losses due to theft and of animals or straying.\\nThe Division of Fairs & Expositions (F&E) provides fiscal and policy oversight of the network of California's 78 fairs and manages the use of available funding and other services.\\nThe Inspection Services Division (IS) states their mission is to \\\"provide professional services that support and contribute to a safe, abundant, quality food supply; environmentally sound agricultural practices; and an equitable marketplace for California agriculture,\\\" and states:\\n\\nWe fulfill this mission by providing the following services: Inspect fruits, vegetables and nuts to ensure maturity, grade, size, weight, packaging and labeling meet the consumers' quality expectations. Conduct chemical analysis in support of food and environmental safety. Perform verification audits to ensure good handling and agricultural practices are utilized to contribute to a safe food supply.

The California Organic Program is fully funded by industry registration fees.\\nThe Division of Marketing Services conducts research and information gathering, disburses marketing and economic information, assures producers are paid for their products, assists the dairy industry in maintaining stable marketing conditions, and provides mediation to resolve problems amongst producers and handlers.\\nThe Division of Measurement Standards works with county sealers of weights and measures to verify the quantity of packaged and bulk commodities, to ensure the accuracy of commercial measuring and weighing devices, and to enforce the quality, labeling, and advertising standards for most petroleum products.\\nThe Plant Health and Pest Prevention Services Division (Plant Health Division) conducts pest prevention and management programs that effectively protects California's horticulture, agriculture, natural resources, and urban environments from invasive or dangerous plant pests.\\n\\n\\n== Board of Food and Agriculture ==\\nThe California State Board of Food and Agriculture is an advisory board to the governor and secretary.

After an initial spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties, hundreds of reports of adverse health effects and plans to expand the spraying into the Bay Area resulted in negative media attention, several state legislative responses to close the loophole that allowed the spraying without an environmental impact report, rejection of the plan by numerous city and county councils, and an investigative report by the Associated Press that led to the suspension of a nearly $500,000 public relations campaign undertaken by the CDFA to \\\"counter the concerns raised by local environmentalists and residents, who complained of breathing problems and other ill health effects after the spraying.\\\"  In March 2008, the mayor of Albany, California, Robert Lieber, called for the resignation of CDFA Secretary Kawamura.\\nCDFA is responsible for writing regulations to implement 2018 California Proposition 12, which implements minimum space requirements farm animals which produce animal products for the California market. This became the subject of litigation. On May 11, 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States decided the case, National Pork Producers Council v. Ross, and upheld Proposition 12.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\\nCalifornia Agriculture (journal)\\nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nFood and Agriculture in the California Code of Regulations\\nCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculture on LittleSis, a website that publishes data on who-knows-who between government, donors and business\"}"}}
