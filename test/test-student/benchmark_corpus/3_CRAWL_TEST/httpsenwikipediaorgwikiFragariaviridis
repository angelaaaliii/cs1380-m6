It has fruits with fine flavour. They have surprisingly little of the usual strawberry aroma, but a refreshing acidity, and sometimes ripen without becoming red. When they are plucked from the plant, the calyx will usually adhere and they will detach with a noticeable snapping sound.\\nAll strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. Fragaria viridis is diploid, having 2 pairs of these chromosomes for a total of 14 chromosomes. Fragaria viridis is approximately 6.24 million years old.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWild strawberry\\nMusk strawberry\\nStrawberry\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nDen Virtuella Floran Swedish site with good F. viridis photos.\\n\\\"Fragaria viridis\\\".
