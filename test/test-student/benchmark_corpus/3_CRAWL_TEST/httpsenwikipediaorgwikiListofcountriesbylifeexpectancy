The data is differentiated by sex, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. \\nThis article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \\\"full health\\\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2022 report.\\n\\n\\n== Methodology ==\\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed, as well as other factors including HIV infections.\\nFrom the start of the 21st century, estimates of healthy life expectancy (HALE), the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \\\"full health\\\", are also produced.\\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be difficult, due to poor reporting in some countries and different local standards in collecting statistics. \\nThis is especially true for healthy life expectancy, the definition of which may change over time, even within a country. For example, Canada is a country with a fairly high overall life expectancy at 81.63 years. This number decreases to 75.5 years for Indigenous people in Canada. This discrepancy is echoed in most quality of life metrics across Canada.\\n\\n\\n== United Nations (2023) ==\\nEstimations are by the analytical agency of the UN. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include such countries as Monaco (LE 86.37 years, population 39,000), San Marino (LE 85.71 years, population 34,000), and Saint Barth√©lemy (LE 84.29 years, population 11,000). The values are rounded. All calculations were made with raw data.\\nThese values are used to calculate the Human Development Index.\\n\\n\\n=== UN: Estimate of life expectancy for various ages in 2023 ===\\nLocation links in this table are \\\"Demographics by LOCATION\\\" links.\\n\\n\\n=== UN: Change of life expectancy from 2019 to 2023 ===\\n\\n\\n== World Bank Group (2022) ==\\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2022. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\\nIn 2014, some of the world's leading countries had a local peak in life expectancy, so this year is chosen for comparison with 2019 and 2022.\\n\\n\\n== World Health Organization (2019) ==\\nAccording to data published by the World Health Organization in December 2020. By default, data is sorted by life expectancy at birth for all population, and in case of equal values by HALE for all population.\\n\\n\\n== CIA World Factbook (2022) ==\\nThe US CIA published the following life expectancy data in its World Factbook.\\n\\n\\n== OECD (2022) ==\\nLife expectancy estimates in the OECD for 2022.
