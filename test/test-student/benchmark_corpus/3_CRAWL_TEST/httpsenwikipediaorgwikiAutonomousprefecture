The official name of an autonomous prefecture includes the most significant minority in that region, sometimes two, rarely three. For example, a prefecture with a large number of Kazakhs (Kazak in official naming system) may be called a Kazak Autonomous Prefecture. Like all other prefectural level divisions, autonomous prefectures are divided into county level divisions. There is one exception: Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture contains two prefectures of its own. Under the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, autonomous prefectures cannot be abolished.\\n\\n\\n== Autonomous administrative divisions ==\\n\\nThe PRC's autonomous administrative divisions may be found in the first (or top) to third levels of its national administrative divisions thus:\\n\\n\\n== List of autonomous prefectures ==\\n\\n\\n== Ethnic composition of autonomous prefectures ==\\nNote: * - denotes as the second titular ethnic group\\n\\n\\n== Former autonomous prefectures of China ==\\nHainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture (1952–1988) in Guangdong, abolished because of the establishment of Hainan Province.\\nHedong Hui Autonomous Prefecture (1954–1955) in Gansu, later changed name as Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture (1955–1958), abolished because of the establishment of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.\\nXihaigu Hui Autonomous Prefecture (1953–1955) in Gansu, later changed name as Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture (1955–1958), abolished because of the establishment of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.\\nGuixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture (sub-provincial level, 1953–1955) in Guangxi Province, abolished because of the establishment of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.\\nBayinhot Mongol Autonomous Prefecture (1954–1956) in Gansu, included today's Dengkou County and Alxa League.
