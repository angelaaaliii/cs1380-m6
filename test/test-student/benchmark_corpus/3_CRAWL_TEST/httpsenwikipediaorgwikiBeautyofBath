Sugar 13%, acid 13g/litre, vitamin C 12mg/100g.\\n'Beauty of Bath' is a very early apple usually cropping in August but can crop as early as July (e.g. in 2011) or last into September.  It bruises easily, so is best picked by hand.  Fruits can drop early by themselves, often when not completely ripe.  Traditionally, straw was placed under the trees to lessen damage to falling fruit.\\nThe fruit's taste is sharp at first but sweetens later. The flesh is white but sometimes has a red flush under the skin (approximately 20% occurrence noticed in 2011 in one orchard).\\nThe tree is in flowering group 2 with pale pink blossom and medium to large, blue-green, leaves.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== References ==\"}"}}
